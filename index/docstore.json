Unit -linking is simply a way of working out \nthe value of your plan on any particular date. You do not own the \nunits. The plan will be linked to units in one or more of the funds \nlisted in section 1.  \nEach time you make a contribution we place units from one or more \nof the funds into the plan according to the terms of the latest fund \nlink and i n the way described in secti on 4 . We use the unit price of \neach fund to work out the number of units from each fund, which \nwe will place in the plan.  \nOur current policy is to use unit prices effective on the same \nworking day we receive your contribution. We may change this \npolicy in the future to use unit prices effective on a different date.  \nIf you have chosen to invest in certain funds there may be a \nmaximum amount that you are allowed to invest in each fund.  \nThe value of a unit (known as the unit price) will go down as well as \nup o ver time, depending on how the assets in the fund perform. \nWe work out the price of units in all of the funds by using the \nmarket value of the assets of the fund and taking off the fund \ncharge.  You can find details of how we work out fund prices in our Fu nd \nOperating Procedures governing the funds. You can get a copy of \nthese online at www.irishlife.ie  or from our Head Office.  \nYour fund value on any particular  date will be equal to:  \n\u2022 the number of units we have placed in your investment from each \nfund;  \nmultiplied by  \n\u2022 the price for units of that fund on that date; and  \n\u2022 added together for each of the funds in your investment.  \nAs a result, this fund value will go down as well as up over time as \nthe unit prices change to reflect the value of the assets in the funds.  \nDelay Periods  \nIn certain circumstances, we may need to delay new investments . \nSome of the reasons can include if:   \n\u2022 large number of customers wishing to invest in their fund at \nthe same time . \n\u2022 there are practical problems buying the assets within the \nfund or for an externally managed fund . \n\u2022 an external manager who is responsible for the investment of \nany part of the fund imposes such a delay.  \n\u2022 you invest in markets or funds with assets with signif icant \ntime differences including trading or settlement time \ndifferences.

The actual level of charges may \nbe higher or lower than this. The section on variable charges below \nexplains the reasons for this.  \nWhere the estimated average level of the variable charge is 0%, this \nindicates that  the fund  manager may at some point choose to  invest \nin assets which attract additional charges bu t the current expectation \nis that they will not.  \n3.1 Variable Charges  \nAs noted above the charge on a number of funds can vary and \ntherefore is not fixed throughout the lifetime of your plan.  \nThe charge noted in the above table reflects our best estimate of the \ntotal charges we expect will be incurred by the fund over the lo ng \nterm. However, the actual charges you incur may vary for the \nreasons given below.  \nFunds with variable charges   \nFunds are administered at an overall level by Irish Life. For some funds, \na part or all of the assets are managed by companies (external \nmanag ers) other than Irish Life. There are charges taken from these \nfunds by both Irish Life and these fund managers.  \nThe fund managers take their costs and charges from the assets they \nmanage. These charges are reflected in how the funds perform. The level of the charges they take, as a percentage of the overall fund, can \nvary for several reasons.  \n\u2022 The first reason is the fact that the  charges on the overall fund \nwill vary according to the  proportion  of the fund  invested in \neach of the underlying funds and the s pecific charges for \nthese funds.  The underlying funds may also change in the \nfuture and different charges for the new funds may lead to \noverall fund charge changing . \n\u2022 The second reason is that the costs associated with managing \na fund may vary and change ov er time.  These costs include, \nfor example, licen se fee s where funds track a particular index, \nlegal, accounting and marketing costs.  \n\u2022 The third reason is that some  funds may borrow to increase the \namount of assets that th e funds can invest in. Borrowing \nincreases the chance of achieving improved returns if the assets \nperform well. However, it also increases the level of risk of the \ninvestment. The fund  managers\u2019  charges in relation to \ninvestments are based on the total val ue of the assets held \nincluding any borrowings made rather than on the funds they \nmanage. The level of these charges as a percentage of the funds \nmanaged will depend on the amount of borrowing relative to \nthe value of the assets held.  \nIf the level of borr owing increases by more than the value of \nassets, the level of charges as a percentage of funds managed  \nwould increase. For example, a  significant fall in asset values \ncould result in a significant increase in the average level of this \ncharge as a percenta ge of funds managed. This is because a fall", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "04710669-ee4c-4aaf-962a-3a1c4e07f7b5": {"__data__": {"id_": "04710669-ee4c-4aaf-962a-3a1c4e07f7b5", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "12", "file_name": "Clear Invest T&C.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "8ee4f351-b56e-4cf7-948c-e62308bd8c85", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "12", "file_name": "Clear Invest T&C.pdf"}, "hash": "1db00d4a6ad32c3b8795139146ac799d1a34718d2af1b1b7eb89d7b09472b2be"}}, "hash": "685ee1fab95f97e4caf4a18972a046a2cae0c9458bf42e92a33f72893c095088", "text": "10 in asset values means that the amounts borrowed would \nrepresent a higher percentage of the fund value.  \nEqually, if the level of borrowing reduces by more than the value \nof assets, then the level of charges as a percentage of funds \nmanaged would also reduce. For example, a significant rise in \nasset values could result in a significant reduction in the average \nlevel of this charge as a percentage of the funds managed. This \nis because a rise in asset values means th at the amounts \nborrowed would represent a lower percentage of the fund \nvalue.  \nTaking account of these factors, we estimate that the estimated \naverage level of charges on the funds will be split as on the previous \ntable. The actual level of the estimated fund manager variable charge, \nand therefore the total expected charge, may be higher or lower than \nthis depending on the factors outlined above.  \n3.3 Additional points to note  \nCounterparty Risk  \nWe are not liable for any loss incurred by any of the  investments in \nthe funds available under this plan. It is important to note that the \nvalue of investments with any fund manager may be affected if any \nof the institutions with whom money is placed suffers insolvency or \nany other financial difficulties. Th e value of your units will reflect \nthe value of the assets recovered from that manager. Irish Life  will \nnot use any of our assets to make up any shortfall . \nCurrency  \nCertain funds contain assets which are invested outside of the Euro \nzone. The fund managers  may use currency protection against any changes in the value of those currencies against the Euro. The cost of \nany currency protection used is charged to your fund.  Where the fund \nmanager has not used currency protection, there is a risk that your \nplan va lue will be adversely affected by changes in currency exchange \nrates.   \nExternal Funds  \nWhere a fund invests in an external fund, we will represent the key \nfeatures of the external fund in our literature. However, the \nmanagers of external funds may retain di scretion over the nature \nand choice of assets, custodians and institutions with whom they \nplace money and expenses incurred, within any part of a fund they \nmanage. Our commitment to you is to pass on the full value of the \nfund we receive from the external manager for your investment. \nWe are not liable for any pricing inaccuracies related to the external \nproviders  or any losses caused by the acts and omissions of an \nexternal provider . Our commitment is restricted to the returns we \nactually receive from the e xternal manager.  \nWhere funds are managed by external fund managers, the \ninvestments may be legally held in other countries other than \nIreland. Where a fund is based will impact on how it is regulated.   \nFunds containing property  \nWe take the costs of maintaining and valuing the properties in these \nfunds and the costs of collecting rent off the funds before we take any \ncharges.  \nIncentive fees  \nAn incentive fee may be paid to some fund managers  if they achieve \npositive investment returns on the funds they  manage.

An \nexample of this is Asian markets.  \n \nDue to the high cost and time involved in buying and selling \nproperties, a delay of this sort is most likely to happen if the plan \nis invested in a property fund (or a fund with a high proportion of \nproperty assets).

Any growth on your investment amount, \nincluding any amount we invest in excess of your investment \namount, is considered a profit earned by you and so is subject to \ntax (where tax is applicable).  \n The tax rate is curr ently 41%. We will pay you the after tax amount . \nIf the plan is owned by a company the tax rate that applies may be \ndifferent.  \nTax is payable on your investment returns when  \n\u2022 You make any withdrawal from your investment  \n\u2022You reach the 8th anniversary of  your investment, and each \nsubsequent 8th anniversary   \n\u2022You die   \n\u2022You transfer all or part of your investment to someone else. There \nare some exceptions to this however you must inform us if you \ntransfer the investment.  \nThe tax payable on each 8th anniversary will reduce the amount \ninvested in the fund from that date o nwards. Where tax is deducted \nfrom your fund on each 8th anniversary, the relevant  tax can be offset against any tax that is payable on a subsequent chargeable \nevent .  \nIn some circumstances, additional tax may be due after death. For \nexample, if the death benefit is paid to your estate, your \nbeneficiaries may have to pay inheritance tax. There is no \ninheritance tax due on an inheritance between a married couple  or \nregistered civil partners.

The fund that is right for you \ndepends on the amount of risk you are willing to take and how long you want to invest for.CHOOSING THE RIGHT FUND MIX\nAMOUNT OF RISK\nLower-risk funds aim to protect your investment \nfrom large falls in value, but the potential for large gains is lower than if you choose a higher-risk fund.\nHigher-risk funds, such as those investing in \ncompany shares, do not aim to protect your investment from large falls in value, but you do have the potential to gain much more, especially over the long-term. If you invest in these types of funds, you should realise that, in wanting a higher return, you need to accept that the value of these funds can move up and down, sometimes by large amounts.VOLATILITY SCALE AND RISK LEVELS\nTo help you choose between funds we rate the possible level of \u2018volatility\u2019 of each fund on an Irish Life scale of IL1 to IL7 (volatility refers to the potential ups and downs that a fund may experience over time).\nA fund with an Irish Life risk level of IL1 is \na lower-risk fund and a risk level of IL7 is a higher-risk fund. You should remember that risk and potential return are closely linked. In other words, investments which are higher-risk tend to have higher returns over the long-term, but can also experience higher falls.\nOur volatility scale assumes that all investments \nare held on a long-term basis. If an investment is held for a short-term, it will usually have a greater level of risk than the volatility scale shows. You can usually reduce the level of risk attached to an investment by diversifying (splitting the investment \u2018eggs\u2019 between different \u2018baskets\u2019) and leaving the investment where it is for a longer period of time (in other words, the longer you hold volatile investments for, the less volatile the returns become).\nThe volatility rating of a fund can change. \nTherefore the volatility ratings in this booklet \nmay not be the most up-to-date ratings. Please \nvisit our website www.irishlife.ie to see the most \nup-to-date volatility ratings.

These aim to reduce the level of ups and downs the fund may experience.   Risk-management strategies will be reviewed regularly by ILIM and may be changed where ILIM  see opportunities to help optimise the performance of each of the funds in terms of achieving their long-term risk and performance objectives.\nEach of the current risk-management strategies are described below.\nIRISH LIFE MAPS\u00ae DIVERSIFICATION\nAs the table on page 12 shows, each of the Irish Life MAPS funds is diversified across a range of \nasset types - shares, bonds, property, cash and external managers / alternatives. Within each of these different asset types, there is even further diversification. For example, within the share asset class there is an allocation to global shares, low-volatility shares, infrastructure shares and an option strategy, each of which generates a return in a different way. \n\u2022  Global shares aim to capture the movement in share markets across the developed and emerging \nmarkets. \n\u2022  The low-volatility strategy invests in shares with certain characteristics that aim to deliver a smoother journey.\n\u2022   The option strategy further diversifies the allocation to shares, aiming to provide a more stable \nreturn over time. \n\u2022   Infrastructure shares aim to generate a smoother return from investing in long term regulated assets like ports, electricity or roads.\nThis level of diversification aims to ensure that the performance of the funds is not dependent on any \none asset type, sector, geographical region, investment manager or investment style. Removing this dependence aims to produce a smoother investment journey over the longer-term.\nREGULAR REVIEWS\nILIM regularly review Irish Life MAPS, evaluating the current assets and managers to make sure they continue to represent the best of ILIM thinking and capability with respect to achieving their long-term risk and performance objectives. The process takes into account the short, medium and long-term expected outlook for investment markets with a view to creating the best fund mix. Typically in these reviews, ILIM are looking for opportunities to either refine the way they manage risk or increase the expected fund returns. This process involves reviewing investment opportunities such as choosing new managers, asset classes, strategies, geographies, developments in research and analysing how best to include any prospective changes into the existing funds.\nWarning: The value of your investment may go down as well as up.\nWarning: These funds may be affected by changes in currency exchange rates.\nWarning: These figures are estimates only.

ILIM developed the DSC model \nand it is a market first in Ireland.  It uses a many factors to identify long-term stock-market trends and movements. \nThe advantage of having the DSC is that, when the strategy identifies greater potential for falls in the \nstock-market, it aims to reduce the amount invested in global shares and increase the amount in cash. And importantly, when the DSC identifies greater potential for stock-market recovery, it will move back out of cash and into global shares.\nIt is important to note that the DSC looks at long-term movements and trends in the market and is not \ndesigned to react to one-off or short-term jumps or shocks. Currently DSC applies to Global Shares, \nILIM will continually review this and, in the future, a similar process may apply to other assets.\nGLOBAL LOW-VOLATILITY SHARES\nThis strategy aims to manage volatility while maintaining share market returns over the longer-term.  \nThe strategy is focussed on minimising maximum losses.  ILIM select stocks based on a range of low-risk factors and through this stock selection process aim to minimise the total potential fall experienced over time.\nOPTION STRATEGY\nThe option strategy further diversifies the allocation to shares aiming to provide a more stable return over time. ILIM will sell put options on equity indices with the aim of reducing the impact on the fund of ups and downs in the stock-market. Whilst the strategy may not benefit from the full increase in equity indices if they rise sharply, it is protected from some of the market falls. \nCURRENCY HEDGING\nILIM manage the risk of exposure to foreign currencies in Irish Life MAPS by fully or partly hedging any exposure. The strategy aims to reduce the risk of experiencing negative returns from foreign currency \nmoves. This is achieved by hedging non-euro currency exposure when it is beneficial to do so.\nWarning: The value of your investment may go down as well as up.\nWarning: These funds may be affected by changes in currency exchange rates.\nWarning: If you invest in this product you may lose some or all of the money you invest.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "279dfd05-c385-4113-a73d-47b6e082e708": {"__data__": {"id_": "279dfd05-c385-4113-a73d-47b6e082e708", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "19", "file_name": "Clear Invest.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "fd1eb548-a514-4d45-a281-f94246705ad9", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "19", "file_name": "Clear Invest.pdf"}, "hash": "b206f59c810afffd98962fd7d55f26b2b2dffe21e3cc5d6467e203d3acf56ed5"}}, "hash": "b206f59c810afffd98962fd7d55f26b2b2dffe21e3cc5d6467e203d3acf56ed5", "text": "17\nIRISH LIFE RISK RATING IL2\nMulti-Asset Portfolio Fund 2   \n(Volatility IL2)\nThis fund invests in a mix of assets such as \nbonds, shares, property, cash and externally managed funds.

We will send you a Customer Information Notice specific to your investment with your welcome pack which will show the impact of charges on your chosen investment amount.\nWHAT IS THE SMALLEST AMOUNT I CAN INVEST?\nYou can start investing in Clear Invest with \u20ac10,000 and usually add extra lump-sums of \u20ac1,000 or more. The largest total amount you can invest in the Property Portfolio Fund is \u20ac1,000,000.\nWHO CAN INVEST IN CLEAR INVEST?\nYou must be living in the Republic of Ireland and aged between 18 to 74. In the case of Joint Life plans, both investors must be aged 74 (75 next birthday) or under.\nCAN I TAKE A REGULAR WITHDRAWAL?\nYou can ask us to automatically cash in part of your Clear Invest plan every month, three months, six months or year. This service is free of charge. There is no early withdrawal charge for taking a regular withdrawal. The maximum percentage you can take is 5% of the value of your fund a year (before tax). If you want to take a monthly amount, we will pay it direct to your bank. Any regular amount we pay you will be taxed based on the growth made by the percentage of the plan you are withdrawing.\nThe tax rate is currently 41%. We pay this tax \nto the Revenue Commissioners on your behalf and then pay the amount left to you. If your plan grows by a lower percentage than the regular withdrawal taken, the value of your plan will fall and could be less than you originally invested.Warning: The income you get from this investment may go down as well as up.\nCAN I CHANGE MY PAYMENT AMOUNTS?\nYou can top up your Clear Invest plan at any \ntime, as long as the extra lump-sum you invest is at least \u20ac1,000. We will invest your extra \npayment in the same way as we invest your \noriginal lump-sum at that time. \nCAN I CASH IN PART OF MY CLEAR \nINVEST?\nYes, you can cash in part of your Clear Invest at \nany stage. You must cash in at least \u20ac350 (after tax), and the value of your investment after you \ncash in any of your plan must be at least \u20ac1,250. \nYou will have to pay tax on any profit you make. Please see page 21 \u2018What are the charges\u2019 for details on when the early withdrawal charges \nwill apply.\nCAN I SWITCH FUNDS?\nYes, you can switch between any of the funds, \nfree of charge, as often as you like.\nHowever, please note:\n\u2022 We may delay switches out of the Property \nPortfolio Fund from the time we receive your request.

The tax rate is currently 41%. If the plan is owned by a company the tax rate that applies may be different. We will pay you the amount remaining after tax.\nWe will pay this tax (if it is due):\n\u2022 when you cash in all or part of your plan;\n\u2022 when you die, or if the plan is owned by two \npeople, when the last surviving owner dies;\n\u2022 when you transfer ownership of your plan to someone else. There are some exceptions to this however; you must inform us if you transfer ownership of the investment to someone else; or\n\u2022 every 8th anniversary from the start of your plan. Where tax is deducted from your \nfund on each 8th anniversary, this tax can \nbe offset against any tax that is payable on a \nsubsequent encashment.\nLIFE INSURANCE LEVY\nWe will collect any government taxes or levies and pass them directly to the Revenue Commissioners. The current government levy on life insurance payments is 1%.\nYou may also have to pay tax on funds that \ninvest in property outside Ireland. Under current UK tax law, income received from rent on UK property investments is subject to tax, after certain expenses and interest payments. The current rate is 20% (as at January 2020). This tax will be taken from the fund and reflected in the fund\u2019s value. For investments in European property, tax will be paid on profit from rent if this is required by the tax rules of the relevant country. In some instances, depending on the tax rules of the country, capital gains tax may also be due on any growth in the value of your plan. Any tax due will be taken from the fund and be reflected in the fund\u2019s value. If tax laws and practice change during the term, this will be reflected in the fund value. This information is based on current tax law, which could change in the future.WHAT HAPPENS IF I DIE?\nIf you die, we will pay out 100.1% of the value \nof your fund, less any tax. If you are a joint \ninvestor, and one of you dies, your Clear Invest \nwill transfer to the other investor. You should understand that if you die, the value of your fund is not protected and could be higher or lower than the amount you invested.\nCAN I CHANGE MY MIND?\nWe want to make sure that you are happy with your decision to invest in Clear Invest. So, we will give you 30 days from the day we send you your investment documents to change your mind. If you cancel the plan within 30 days, all benefits will end and we will refund your investment less any fall in the value of your investment that may have taken place during the 30-day period. The 30-day period starts from the day we send you your Clear Invest Welcome Pack.\nEXTERNAL MANAGERS\nWithin the Multi-Asset Portfolio Funds and the Property Portfolio Fund, some of the assets are managed by companies (external managers) other than the Irish Life Investment Managers (ILIM). There will be charges taken from these funds by both us and these external managers.\nFor these funds, it is important to note the value \nof any investment placed with these managers may be affected if any of the institutions with whom we place money suffers insolvency or other financial difficulty. Our commitment is to pass on the full value of the assets we receive from the external manager for your plan. Our commitment is restricted to the amounts we actually receive from the external manager.\nIf you invest in funds managed by an external fund manager, it is likely that the way your investment performs in those funds using our products will be slightly different from the performance of the external manager funds themselves. This could be due to factors such as the time needed to move your investment into their funds and any changes in the values of currencies (please see Currency section below).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "0e0d1615-af66-41fb-8608-71974d200e59": {"__data__": {"id_": "0e0d1615-af66-41fb-8608-71974d200e59", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "26", "file_name": "Clear Invest.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "44dec510-06de-4980-a052-23e985efacc4", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "26", "file_name": "Clear Invest.pdf"}, "hash": "b7fc5c0f6ede43e23ad28a7273282bfffb46b8f29564bdba229e600fba38cbab"}}, "hash": "b7fc5c0f6ede43e23ad28a7273282bfffb46b8f29564bdba229e600fba38cbab", "text": "24\nWhere funds are managed by external fund \nmanagers, the investments may be legally held in countries other than Ireland. You should be aware that where a fund is domiciled will impact on how it is regulated.\nVARIABLE FUND CHARGES\nWe won\u2019t increase the charges outlined earlier unless we need to because of an increase in the costs of dealing with the investment.\nHowever, the charges on the Multi-Asset \nPortfolio Funds and the Property Portfolio Fund are variable which means they can be higher or lower than the charges shown in this booklet.\nThe charges on a fund may also vary if that \nfund can invest in a range of other funds. The proportion invested in each fund may vary over time. Variable charges may be added to other funds over time.\nSince fund charges vary between funds, the \noverall fund charge will vary depending on the weighting of individual investments in each fund. \nAlso, if the charges on individual funds change, \nthe overall charge will vary as a result.\nThe factors that may cause the level of variable \ncharges to be higher or lower than that shown are outlined in your Terms and Conditions booklet.\nCOUNTERPARTY RISK\nIt is important to note that the value of investments with any fund manager may be affected if any of the institutions with whom money is placed with becomes insolvent or suffer any other financial difficulties. The value of your units will reflect the value of the assets recovered from that manager. We will not use any of our assets to make up any shortfall.\nNOTICE PERIODS (DELAYS)\nIn certain circumstances, we may delay switches, withdrawals or transfers out of a fund. This is referred to as the \u2018notice period\u2019. This may be because there are a large number of customers wishing to switch into or out of the fund at the same time, or if there are practical problems buying or selling the assets within the fund or if an external manager who is responsible for the investment of any part of the \nfund imposes such a delay. Delayed transactions \nwill be based on the value of units at the end of \nthe period when the transaction actually takes \nplace. If you have invested in a property fund, a significant delay would be likely to apply, depending on the nature of the underlying \nassets. This delay will be no more than 18 \nmonths. Once you have given us notice that you \nwant to switch, withdraw or transfer out of a fund, you cannot change your mind during any notice period.\nCURRENCY\nFunds investing outside the eurozone\nFunds that invest outside of the eurozone \ncarry a risk related to currency. This is because the funds are priced in euro but the assets in which the fund invests are valued in their local currency. This can reduce your returns depending upon how those local currencies are performing compared with the euro.\nFor example, Multi-Asset Portfolio Funds may \ninvest a portion in UK companies\u2019 shares. Since the shares are priced in pounds sterling, the value of the Multi-Asset Portfolio Fund could be affected both by how the shares of the companies perform and any movements in the euro and sterling exchange rate. If, for example, there has been no change in the value of the shares in sterling, but sterling falls in value against the euro, the Multi-Asset Portfolio Fund could fall in value. Obviously, in the same circumstances, a rise in the value of sterling could result in an increase in the value of the Multi-Asset Portfolio Fund. Some funds which invest in assets outside of the eurozone may try to manage the risk related to movements in exchange rates. The cost of trying to protect against currency movements will be charged to the fund on an on-going basis. Changes in exchange rates during the investment term in funds which are not protected against currency movements may have a negative effect on the value of these funds and the expected \ninvestment returns.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "56706b21-bc52-4159-9f31-c626a4a30bad": {"__data__": {"id_": "56706b21-bc52-4159-9f31-c626a4a30bad", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "27", "file_name": "Clear Invest.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "6ec33e1e-b545-452e-92ea-21cc3b908331", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "27", "file_name": "Clear Invest.pdf"}, "hash": "5cc63a722fa4c3692b415ad4c96a52f508479f5c490ed73734f146f75897b6d1"}}, "hash": "5cc63a722fa4c3692b415ad4c96a52f508479f5c490ed73734f146f75897b6d1", "text": "25\nEqually, some fund managers will try not \nto manage the risk related to movements in exchange rates and the value of your investment will be fully exposed to exchange rate movements.\nREDUCING THE VALUE OF THE FUND\nWhen there are more customers moving out of a fund than making new investments in it, we may reduce the value of the units in the fund to reflect the percentage of the costs associated with buying and selling the assets of the fund. The reduction is likely to be most significant for the percentage of any fund invested in property.\nINCENTIVE FEES\nSome fund managers may take an incentive fee if they achieve certain investment returns on the funds they manage. Depending on the particular fund, circumstances in which they may take an incentive fee include the following:\n\u2022 If the investment returns go over a certain \nlevel in any calendar quarter.\n\u2022 If the investment returns go over a certain level each year.\n\u2022 If the investment returns achieved in a particular year are greater than the previous highest investment return.\n\u2022 If the returns achieved by these funds go \nover the performance of a benchmark fund.\nIf the fund manager takes an incentive fee this \nwill be reflected in the unit price of the fund.\nFor more information on incentive fees please \nsee www.irishlife.ie.\nGLOBAL CASH FUND\nAs well as the nine fund options shown in this booklet, after you start this plan you can switch into the Global Cash Fund. This fund invests in bank deposits and short-term investments on international and domestic money markets. It is intended to be a lower-risk investment, but you should know that this fund could fall in value. This could happen if, for example, a bank the \nfund has a deposit with cannot pay that deposit \nback, or if the fund charge is greater than the \ngrowth rate of the assets in the fund. This fund is rated as a IL1 on our volatility scale of IL1 to IL7.\nThe Global Cash Fund allows you to move your \nmoney out of the other fund options for short periods of time, if you feel that it is appropriate.\nWe do not recommend you invest in this fund \nover the long-term. The Irish Life fund charge is 1.5% a year.\nPROPERTY PORTFOLIO FUND\nFor the European part of the Property Portfolio Fund, Irish Life Investment Managers (ILIM) choose and manage a mix of indirect property investments across Europe (indirect property investment refers to property investment through other fund managers and not through ILIM). ILIM will identify and invest in some of Europe\u2019s leading property managers. The fund may use borrowings to increase the amount of property that they will invest in. Some of the European part of the Property Portfolio Fund may be invested in countries that are outside the Eurozone area.\nFunds that invest directly in property are \ndifferent from other types of funds in a number of ways.\n1 The property cycle \u2013 selling costs and \ndelays\nThe property market reacts slower than  \nstock-markets and tends to follow more of a \ncycle. It can rise or fall for longer periods and \nin a more consistent way than the stock-market does. This is partly because it takes more time and is more expensive to buy and sell properties \nthan to buy or sell shares. As a result, if there \nare more investors who want to cash in their \ninvestments than there are new investors, we may need to make the following changes so that all investors pay their fair share of the costs the funds have to pay.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "8eda4cf1-95e7-4ccc-84de-14a684abdb83": {"__data__": {"id_": "8eda4cf1-95e7-4ccc-84de-14a684abdb83", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "28", "file_name": "Clear Invest.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "7a91c529-a70f-46c0-b24b-b7c75401cc0d", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "28", "file_name": "Clear Invest.pdf"}, "hash": "c8cb7c7a31ec85bf3509625e7d46d9719c17bc0db79dfa961c636ff96b7a5a9e"}}, "hash": "ebed222ccba74cd3e1ebca464c3e8e2b768bca2a56b262a86f5176e8d594966a", "text": "26\nNotice periods (delays)\nIn certain circumstances, we may delay \nswitches, withdrawals or transfers out of a fund. This is referred to as the \u2018notice period\u2019. This may be because there are a large number of customers wishing to switch into or out of the fund at the same time, or if there are practical problems buying or selling the assets within the fund or if an external manager who is responsible for the investment of any part of the fund imposes such a delay. Delayed transactions will be based on the value of units at the end of the period when the transaction actually takes place.\nDue to the high cost and time involved in \nbuying or selling properties, a delay of this sort is most likely to happen if you are invested in a property fund (or a fund with a high proportion of property or property related assets). The length of any delay will depend on how long it takes us to buy or sell the assets in the fund. A significant delay would be likely to apply in this situation depending on the nature of the underlying assets. This delay will be no more than 18 months. Once you have given us notice that you want to switch, withdraw or transfer out of a fund, you cannot change your mind during any notice period.\nReducing the value of the fund\nWhen there are more customers moving out of \na fund than making new investments in it, we \nmay reduce the value of the units in the fund to \nreflect the percentage of the costs associated \nwith buying and selling the assets of the fund. \nThe reduction is likely to be most significant for \nthe percentage of any fund invested in property.\nFor those funds invested in property, the actual \nreduction will depend on the percentage of property in the fund and the actual costs involved in having to sell properties within that fund. If a reduction in value were to apply today, we estimate this rate could possibly be in the region of 10%, assuming that the fund has a high percentage invested in property. To arrive at this rate, we have estimated the selling costs that might apply. It is possible that the reduction in \nvalue could be higher or lower in the future and could take place in stages. Funds with a lower \nproperty asset mix will have a lower reduction rate.\nThe reduction for any part of a fund invested \nwith external fund managers may happen at a different time to the reduction for the rest of the fund.\n2 Access to cash\nAs it normally takes time to buy and sell \nproperties, the Property Portfolio Fund usually \nneeds to keep a certain level of cash. This helps to cover the expected day-to-day level of \nwithdrawals from the fund, so we don\u2019t have \nto sell properties each time a customer asks to \nwithdraw part of their plan. However, from time \nto time, the level of cash in the fund can rise if the fund manager cannot find the quality of \nproperty investments that they are looking for. \nIf this happens, the fund manager may increase \nthe level of indirect property investment until \nthey find the right properties for these funds.\n3 Using borrowings\nThe Property Portfolio Fund can invest in \nproperty markets indirectly through other fund managers. This means that rather than us buying properties directly, we invest your money with other fund managers. For example, we may invest in a fund which itself invests directly in property. The other fund managers use money invested in their funds to borrow extra money. As a result, the amount of property in these funds can increase which, in turn, increases the possibility for growth. This is one of the main attractions of these indirect property funds. You will have the chance to get higher returns if the value of the property paid for by the loans is higher than the cost of repaying the loans.\nHowever, borrowing in this way also increases \nthe possible risks for the fund. It can mean greater losses if the property falls in value. The value of indirect property investments will reflect the total value of the properties in the fund, but with the value of the loans and the interest on them taken off.

The loan to value ratio changes, based on the value of the indirect properties at any given time so this percentage will vary regularly.\nWhat happens if property falls in value?\n\u2022  That part of the fund linked to indirect \nproperty investments will fall in value by a greater amount because of the level of borrowing.\n\u2022  The following are examples.\n-  If the value of the indirect properties falls \nby 10%, and the indirect fund borrowed \n\u20ac3 for every \u20ac1 invested, the actual fall in \nvalue of the indirect part of the investment would be 40%.\n-  If the value of the indirect properties falls by 10%, and the indirect fund borrowed \u20ac2 for every \u20ac1 invested, the actual fall in value of the indirect part of the investment \nwould be 30%.\n-  If the value of the indirect properties falls by 10%, and the indirect fund borrowed \u20ac1 for every \u20ac1 invested, the actual fall in \nvalue of the indirect part of the investment would be 20%.\nThe amount the external fund manager invested indirectly in property may be higher or lower than shown above. The level of borrowing within the part of the fund invested indirectly in property will also change over time. The higher the amount of the loan compared to the amount invested in property, the greater the potential returns. However, the level of risk will be higher.\nGENERAL INFORMATION\nIf you have chosen to invest in a fund that invests in shares or bonds, the assets in that fund may be used for the purpose of securities lending in order to earn an additional return for the fund. While securities lending increases the level of risk within a fund it provides an opportunity to increase the investment return. \nAt any stage we can change the range of fund \noptions that are available. We may decide to stop giving you access to certain funds entirely. In this case you can switch out of these funds into any other funds that are open at the time. We can also restrict the option to switch into any fund. We may also change the manager who manages a particular fund in the future. In various fund descriptions, we explain the asset split that currently applies. The fund manager can change this asset split at any stage in the future.

MAKE SURE THE POLICY MEETS \nYOUR NEEDS!\n Clear Invest is a lump-sum investment \nplan which aims to meet your medium to long term investment requirements. We recommend that you consider Clear Invest as an investment for a term of at least five years.\n Unless you are fully satisfied as to the nature of this commitment having regard to your needs, resources and circumstances, you should not enter into this commitment.\n Your Financial Adviser must indicate whether paragraph a) or paragraph b) below applies.\na)  This investment replaces in whole or in part \nan existing investment with Irish Life, or \nwith another insurer, which has been or is \nto be cancelled or reduced. Your Financial \nAdviser will advise you as to the financial consequences of such replacement and of possible financial loss as a result. You will be \nasked at the beginning of your application \nform to confirm this in writing. Please ensure \nthat you have completed this section of \nthe form and that you are satisfied with the \nexplanations provided by your Financial \nAdviser before you complete the rest of the \napplication form.\nb)  This investment does not replace in whole \nor in part an existing investment with Irish Life or with any other insurer which has been or is to be cancelled or reduced.2.  WHAT HAPPENS IF YOU WANT \nTO CASH IN THE POLICY EARLY OR STOP PAYING PREMIUMS?\n You can cash in your investment at any stage subject to any delay periods mentioned below.\n If you cash in your investment either fully or partly within the first five years, an early withdrawal charge will apply to the amount you receive. We will reduce your fund value by the early withdrawal charge. This charge is equal to 5% of the cash in amount in years one to three, 3% of the cash in amount in year four and 1% of the cash in amount in the fifth year. It applies separately to your initial payment and each extra payment made. This means you may have different early withdrawal charges on different parts of your plan if you have made extra payments.\n The minimum partial withdrawal is \u20ac350 after tax.\n In certain circumstances, we may delay encashments. This may be because there are a large number of customers wishing to put money in or encash their fund or part of their fund at the same time, or if there are practical problems buying or selling the assets within the fund or if afund manager who is responsible for the investment of any part of the fund imposes a delay or if you invest in markets or funds with assets with significant time differences including trading or settlement time differences. E.g Asian markets.\n Due to the high cost and time involved \nin buying or selling properties, a delay of \nthis sort is most likely to happen if you are \ninvested in a property fund (or a fund with \na high proportion of property or property \nrelated assets). The length of any delay will \ndepend on how long it takes us to buy or sell \nthe assets in the fund. A significant delay \nwould be likely to apply in this situation. A.

The reduction in the value of the affected assets will be different for each fund and is likely to be most significant for the proportion of any fund invested in property. The reduction for any part of the fund invested with fund managers may happen at a different time to the reduction for the rest of the fund.\n The value of your investment may go down as well as up. Therefore your cash-in value may be less than the payment you have made.\n3.  WHAT ARE THE PROJECTED \nBENEFITS UNDER THE POLICY?\n The Key Information Documents for this product are available to view at any time on www.irishlife.ie/key-information-documents. These documents are produced in accordance with the European Packaged Retail and Insurance-based Investment Products Directive. The Key Information Documents show examples of the amount you might get back under different scenarios, assuming an investment amount of \u20ac10,000 and using an example charging structure.\n After you take out your policy we will send you a Customer Information Notice with a table of projected benefits under your policy.  The projected values in this document will be calculated using an assumed level of growth and will be based on the amount you have invested and the specific charges that apply to your policy.  They will therefore be different from the information provided in our Key Information Documents. 4.  WHAT INTERMEDIARY/SALES         REMUNERATION IS PAYABLE?\n The Key Information Documents for this \nproduct show all the costs that could apply to \nyour policy assuming an investment amount \nof \u20ac10,000 and using an example charging structure.  The costs shown in the Key Information Documents include any amount we deduct to cover intermediary/sales remuneration.\n After you take out your policy we will send you a Customer Information Notice with a table showing the intermediary/sales remuneration.  The remuneration will be calculated using an assumed level of growth \nand will be based on the amount you have \ninvested and the specific intermediary/sales \nremuneration that applies to your policy.\n5.  ARE RETURNS GUARANTEED \nAND CAN THE PREMIUM BE \nREVIEWED?\n Any illustrations of future performance you receive are not guaranteed. They are neither minimum nor maximum amounts. What your fund will be worth depends on the rate at which your investments grow. You could end up with a fund of more or less than these projected amounts. If you take a regular withdrawal, you should understand that the amount you withdraw could be greater than the growth on your investment. This means that the cash-in value of your investment could be lower than the amount you have invested.\n If the investment return actually achieved is lower or charges higher than that assumed in these illustrations, you will need to increase your payments in order to achieve the funds illustrated.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "a2c08cb1-1ae9-45ad-8deb-6eb8f5c6488e": {"__data__": {"id_": "a2c08cb1-1ae9-45ad-8deb-6eb8f5c6488e", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "35", "file_name": "Clear Invest.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "417032e1-2922-46d9-b367-866074c0916e", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "35", "file_name": "Clear Invest.pdf"}, "hash": "3a383f164656f02bc3fea426d46fa5883e02f257dff58e22c76e7cc95ffd23ed"}}, "hash": "3a383f164656f02bc3fea426d46fa5883e02f257dff58e22c76e7cc95ffd23ed", "text": "33\n6.  CAN THE POLICY BE CANCELLED \nOR AMENDED BY THE INSURER?\n If the cost of administering your Clear Invest \nplan increases unexpectedly we may need \nto increase the charges on your investment. \nAlso we can alter or cancel your Clear Invest plan (or issue another investment in its place) if at any time it becomes impossible or impracticable to carry out any of the investment provisions because of a change in the law or other circumstances beyond our control. If we alter or cancel your Clear Invest plan (or issue another investment in its place), we will send a notice to your last known address explaining the change and \nyour options.\n7.  INFORMATION ON TAXATION \nISSUES?\n Any taxes or levies imposed by the \ngovernment will be collected by Irish Life and passed directly to the Revenue Commissioners.\n Under current Irish tax law (January 2020), tax is payable on any profit made on this plan. Any growth on your investment amount, including any amount we invest in excess of your investment amount, is considered as profit earned by you and so is subject to tax (where tax is applicable).  The tax rate is currently 41%. We will pay you the after tax amount. If the plan is owned by a company the tax rate that applies may be different. \n Tax is payable on your investment returns when\n\u2022  You make any withdrawal (full or partial) \nor take a regular withdrawal from your investment\n\u2022  You reach the 8th anniversary of your investment, and each subsequent 8th anniversary\n\u2022  You die, or if the plan is owned by two people, when the last surviving owner \ndies.\u2022  You transfer all or part of your investment \nto someone else. There are some exceptions to this however you must inform us if you transfer the investment.\n The tax payable on each 8th anniversary will reduce the amount invested in the fund from that date onwards. Where tax is deducted from your fund on each 8th anniversary, this tax can be offset against any tax that is payable on a subsequent full encashment.\n Any tax due will be taken from the fund \nand be reflected in the fund\u2019s value. If tax \nlegislation and practice changes during the \nterm, this will be reflected in the fund value.\n Irish tax legislation means Irish Life must \ndeduct the correct amount of tax payable. \nIrish Life retains absolute discretion to \ndetermine, in accordance with all relevant \nlegislation and guidelines, its application \nand interpretation, the tax treatment of this \ninvestment.\n In some circumstances, additional tax may \nbe due after death. For example, if the death benefit is paid to your estate, your beneficiaries may have to pay inheritance tax. There is no inheritance tax due on an inheritance between a married couple or registered civil partners. In certain circumstances inheritance tax due may be reduced by any tax paid on a death under this investment.\n If payments are made by anyone other than the legal owner of the investment, for example from a company or business account, there may be other tax implications.\n Please contact your Financial Adviser or Irish Life if you do not fully understand the likely tax treatment of any benefits payable in connection with your investment.\n We recommend that you seek independent tax advice in respect of your own specific circumstances.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "abcddec4-96c3-4770-b5ba-65d17cda6c59": {"__data__": {"id_": "abcddec4-96c3-4770-b5ba-65d17cda6c59", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "36", "file_name": "Clear Invest.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "ab93ad4a-88a3-4096-9f0b-06592fd7eb85", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "36", "file_name": "Clear Invest.pdf"}, "hash": "822518927172aed7631d77dfdc056cdd64278aed5234046aecfb0a551c433fb5"}}, "hash": "822518927172aed7631d77dfdc056cdd64278aed5234046aecfb0a551c433fb5", "text": "34\n Funds investing in overseas property or \nother overseas assets.\n Some funds invest wholly or partly in property or other assets outside of Ireland.  Under current UK tax law, income received from rent received on UK property investments is subject to tax, after certain expenses and interest payments. The current rate is 20% (as at January 2020). This tax will be taken from the fund and reflected in the fund\u2019s value. \n For investments in overseas property, tax will be paid on profit from rent if this is required by the tax rules of the relevant country. In some instances, depending on the tax rules of the country, capital gains tax may also be due on any growth in the value of your plan. Any tax due will be taken from the fund and be reflected in the fund\u2019s value.\n For any investments in overseas assets, tax will be deducted on income or gains if this is required by the domestic tax rules \nof the relevant country. In some instances, \nwithholding or other underlying taxes may \napply, depending on the domestic tax rules \nof the relevant country.  \n Any tax due will be from the fund and \nbe reflected in the fund\u2019s value. If tax legislation and practice changes during the term, this will be reflected in the fund value. This information is based on current tax law, which could change in the future.\n8.  ADDITIONAL INFORMATION IN \nRELATION TO YOUR POLICY\n What are the benefits and options provided under this plan?\n \nClear Invest is an investment which aims to meet your medium to long term investment requirements. In addition to making your initial investment you can make further investments into your plan, provided the additional amount you invest is at least \u20ac1,000. In certain circumstances we may decline this additional payment, for example if the fund has closed. However, in that case, we will tell you the reason for our refusal.\n Cashing in all or part of your investment\n You may cash in your investment in full or in part at any time. However, in certain circumstances we may delay part or total withdrawals (please see Section 2).\n You may cash in your investment in full or in part at any time. If you do so more than five years after the start of the plan, you will receive the value of your investment at the date you cash it in less any tax due. If you cash in your plan either fully or partly within the first five years, early withdrawal charges will apply to the amount you receive. We will reduce your fund value by the early withdrawal charge. This charge is equal to 5% of the cash-in amount in years one to three, 3% of the cash-in amount in year four and 1% of the cash-in amount in the fifth year. It applies separately to your initial payment and each extra payment made. This means you may have different early withdrawal charges on different parts of your plan if you have made extra payments.\n The smallest amount you can take from your plan is \u20ac350, after deduction of any exit tax due, provided that the gross value of your investment after you have made a withdrawal is at least \u20ac1,250.   \n Regular Withdrawal\n You can take a regular withdrawal from your \nfund. You can take a withdrawal of up to \n5%, before tax, of the value of your fund \neach year. You can take this withdrawal \nevery month, 3 months, 6 months or every \nyear. There must be \u20ac1,250 left in your \ninvestment at any time. We will pay you \nthe withdrawal as if you were cashing in \npart of your investment on each payment \ndate i.e. we will reduce the value of your \ninvestment by the amount we pay you plus \nany appropriate tax due in respect of this \npayment. No early withdrawal charge will be \napplied in these circumstances.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "692b0b11-ab71-489d-a5a5-2474f56eb3b3": {"__data__": {"id_": "692b0b11-ab71-489d-a5a5-2474f56eb3b3", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "37", "file_name": "Clear Invest.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "4bfddb5f-7970-44fc-b9a3-dce8852a70f3", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "37", "file_name": "Clear Invest.pdf"}, "hash": "1e1d68f855943ff1795a817020925ca80e4759202adad342f83b44f2cb4ed624"}}, "hash": "22597522619ce8d487a484ec556045574a4c3ca7f088e6b0943259b9b14b6ee1", "text": "35\n If you take a regular withdrawal from Clear \nInvest, you should understand that the amount of withdrawal you take could be greater than the growth on your investment. This means that the cash in value of your investment could be lower than the amount you have invested. Full details of any regular withdrawal that you have chosen to take from your investment will be contained in your investment schedule and personalised customer information notice which you will receive as part of your welcome pack.\n Death Benefit\n If you die while the investment is in force (or, for a joint life case, when the second of the investors dies), we will pay 100.1% of the value of your fund, less the appropriate tax.\n What is the term of the contract?\n There is no specified term to Clear Invest. It is an open-ended investment and will remain in force while you are alive until you \ndecide to end it.\n Are there any circumstances under \nwhich the plan may be ended?\n Clear Invest may be ended if, following a partial withdrawal, the value of your investment is less than \u20ac1,250.\n How are the payments invested?\n \nClear Invest is a unit-linked investment. In return for your money we allocate units to Clear Invest from each of your chosen funds as will be listed on your investment schedule. The value of your investment is linked to the value of these units. The value of a unit may go down as well as up over time, depending on how the underlying assets perform. The underlying assets in the fund may be used for the purposes of securities lending in order to earn an additional return for the fund. While securities lending increases the level of risk within a fund, it also provides an opportunity to increase the investment return. Where a fund manager engages in securities lending, they may keep some or all of the revenue from this activity for themselves. Funds \nwhich are managed by Irish Life Investment \nManagers or Setanta Asset Managers will \ninclude securities lending on equities and bonds as part of its investment strategy. The aim of securities lending is to earn an additional return for the fund(s). Securities lending involves the lending of some assets of the fund to selected financial institutions. Whilst the objective is to enhance returns to the fund, in certain circumstances the fund could suffer a loss if the financial institution(s) encountered financial difficulties.\n You do not own the units. Unit-linking is simply a method of working out the value of your investment at any date. The gross value of your investment at any date will be equal to the total of the number of units allocated to your investment from each fund multiplied by the unit price for units of that fund on that date. The value of your investment will therefore go down as well as up over time as the unit prices change to reflect the value of the underlying assets.\n You may, at any time, switch some or all of your money from one fund to another by writing to us to request a switch. We do not make a charge for this service. Therefore, the value of your investment will be the same immediately before and immediately after the switch. However it is important to note, before you switch from your original fund choice(s), that the funds in Clear Invest have different levels of risk and potential return and they may also have different yearly fund charges.  \n In certain circumstances, we may delay switches. This may be because there are a large number of customers wishing to switch into or out of the fund at the same time, or if there are practical problems buying or selling the assets within the fund or if a fund manager who is responsible for the investment of any part of the fund imposes \na delay or if you invest in markets or funds \nwith assets with significant time differences", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "2099fe1d-a7ab-4fe7-98b1-1eb0514c2c82": {"__data__": {"id_": "2099fe1d-a7ab-4fe7-98b1-1eb0514c2c82", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "38", "file_name": "Clear Invest.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "722fb7c0-503b-4bae-a655-4eb0a9744191", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "38", "file_name": "Clear Invest.pdf"}, "hash": "1b76a74a8139c2fb71935d09b241483b5b52952bc0c46c1770d3673b76f8b3c5"}}, "hash": "c78b827496da81b9dfb696769bf2faaece0aa8aea84a3422a7dba2e7c7e8efea", "text": "36\nincluding trading or settlement time \ndifferences e.g Asian markets.\n Due to the high cost and time involved in buying and selling properties, a delay of this sort is most likely to happen if you are invested in a property fund (or a fund with a high proportion of property or property related assets). The length of any delay will depend on how long it takes us to buy or sell the assets in the fund. A significant delay would be likely to apply in this situation. Delayed transactions will be based on the value of units at the end of the period when the transaction actually takes place.\n When there are more customers moving out \nof a fund than making new investments in \nit, or there are more customers making new investments than moving out of the fund, we may reduce the value of the units in the \nfund to reflect the percentage of the costs \nassociated with buying and selling the assets \nof the fund. The reduction in the value of the affected assets will be different for each fund and is likely to be most significant for the \nproportion of any fund invested in property. \nThe reduction for any part of the fund \ninvested with fund managers may happen at a different time to the reduction for the rest of the fund.\n The switch value you receive will be based on the value of your units in the fund at the \nend of any notice period.\n Variable charges\n Funds are administered at an overall level \nby Irish Life. For some funds, a part or all of the assets are managed by companies (fund managers) other than Irish Life.  There are charges taken from these funds by both Irish Life and these fund managers.\n  The fund managers take their costs and charges from the assets they manage. These charges are reflected in how the funds perform. The level of the charges as a percentage of the overall fund can vary for several reasons.\n\u2022 The first reason is the fact that the \ncharges on the overall fund will vary according to the proportion of the fund \ninvested in each of the underlying funds \nand the specific charges for these funds. \nThe underlying funds may also change in the future and different charges for the new funds may lead to overall fund \ncharge changing. \n\u2022 The second reason is that the costs \nassociated with managing a fund may \nvary and change over time.  These costs \ninclude, for example, license fees where \nfunds track a particular index, legal, \naccounting and marketing costs.\n\u2022 The third reason is that some funds \nmay borrow to increase the amount of assets that the funds can invest in. Borrowing increases the chance of achieving improved returns if the assets perform well. However, it also increases the level of risk of the investment. The fund managers\u2019 charges in relation to investments are based on the total value of the assets held including any borrowings made rather than on the funds they manage. The level of these charges as a percentage of the funds managed will depend on the amount of borrowing relative to the value of the assets held.\n  If the level of borrowing increases relative to the value of assets, then the level of charges as a percentage of funds managed would increase. For example, a significant fall in asset values could result in a significant increase in the average level of this charge as a percentage of funds managed. This is because a fall in asset values means that the amounts borrowed would represent a higher proportion of the fund value.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "2542ddd4-5159-4281-80c6-c68e20a7b26c": {"__data__": {"id_": "2542ddd4-5159-4281-80c6-c68e20a7b26c", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "39", "file_name": "Clear Invest.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "7f821af4-442a-411a-9424-054ffd6ea581", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "39", "file_name": "Clear Invest.pdf"}, "hash": "b12c79c410d70c050a8bc093f04051bd74bf28db4befc3725718cd3acf8c5c8e"}}, "hash": "b12c79c410d70c050a8bc093f04051bd74bf28db4befc3725718cd3acf8c5c8e", "text": "37\n  Equally, if the level of borrowing reduces \nrelative to the value of assets, then the level of charges as a percentage of funds managed would also reduce. For example, a significant rise in asset values could result in a significant decrease in the average level of this charge as a percentage of funds managed. This is because a rise in asset values means that the amounts borrowed would represent a lower proportion of the fund value.\n  The charge could also vary if the fund manager receives an incentive fee when they achieve positive investment returns on the funds they manage. \n  The actual level of the fund managers\u2019 charges may be higher or lower than this depending on the factors outlined above. \n Is there an opportunity to change your mind?\n When your investment documents are issued you will have an opportunity to cancel the investment if you are not satisfied that it meets your needs.

ILIM and \nSetanta have policies to consider sustainability risks as part of their investment processes. \nILIM and Setanta believe that considering sustainability risk is in the best interest of \ntheir clients.

The approach to managing sustainability risk \nwill be different depending on the asset class and the investment \nstrategy. Where appropriate we have given our investment managers \nthe authority to use voting rights and to engage with investee \ncompanies on sustainability issues. This helps them to manage \nsustainability risk and deliver more sustainable long-term outcomes. \nWe regularly engage with our investment managers to ensure their \ninvestment approach continues to meet our needs.\n2. What is the likely impact of sustainability risks on the \nreturns of investment products available from Irish Life?\n The impacts of a sustainability risk vary depending on the specific \nrisk and asset class. A sustainability risk may impact a specific \ninvestment fund, it may also impact an economic sector or \ngeographical region and so impact underlying investments of the \nfund. If a sustainability risk occurs, there may be a sudden negative \nimpact on the value of an investment. In extreme circumstances, the \nvalue of the full investment may be lost. Considering sustainability \nrisks as part of investment decisions, as explained in section 1 above, \nhelps minimise the risk of this happening.Investment manager websites:\nILIM:   \nwww.ilim.com/responsible-investing\nSetanta:   \nhttps://www.setanta-asset.com/responsible-\ninvesting/\nAmundi:  \nwww.amundi.com/int/ESG\nFidelity Worldwide Investment:   \nhttps://www.fidelityinstitutional.com/en-gb/\nsustainable-investing/sustainable-investing\nDavy:  \nwww.davy.ie/legal/disclosures/sustainable-\nfinance.html", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "01b62ced-240e-4169-bd79-15eab9407155": {"__data__": {"id_": "01b62ced-240e-4169-bd79-15eab9407155", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "9", "file_name": "Clear PRSA 5% - ILA 7652 (REV 07-23).pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "d59921aa-214c-46e5-b597-3ce5f9bf7354", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "9", "file_name": "Clear PRSA 5% - ILA 7652 (REV 07-23).pdf"}, "hash": "a949d6b8a2488a09a3966bff6b54d4fa3a9cfddf3e3a7094768cc7fa4be9be8e"}}, "hash": "623df286c7c771b00c5a4542677c41f2327d90e8dd5526ba1c43f774a1954942", "text": "9\n3.

Risk rating \nThe funds that are available to you on this PRSA are listed in this section. We rate the possible level of \n\u2018volatility\u2019 for each of our funds on an Irish Life scale of IL1 to IL7. We refer to this as the \u2018volatility scale\u2019 or \nthe \u2018risk level\u2019 of a fund. A fund with an Irish Life risk level of IL1 is lower-risk and an Irish Life risk level of \nIL7 is higher-risk. Volatility refers to the potential ups and downs that a fund may experience over time.\nRisk and potential returns are closely linked. This means that investments that have a higher risk rating \ntend to have higher returns but can also experience higher falls.\nYou can reduce the risk level of an investment by diversifying in different risk levels of funds and leaving \nthe investment where it is for a longer time.\nThe funds available on this plan and their risk rating can change.

An example of this is Asian markets. \n  Due to the high cost and time involved in buying and selling \nproperties, a delay of this sort is most likely to happen if you are \ninvesting in a property fund (or a fund with a high proportion of \nproperty or property related assets). The length of any delay will \ndepend on how long it takes us to buy the assets in the fund. A \nsignificant delay would be likely to apply in this situation. This \ndelay would be no more than 18 months.\n When there are more customers moving out of a fund than \nmaking  new investments in it or when there are more customers \nmaking new investments than moving out of a fund, we may \nreduce the value of the units in the fund to reflect the percentage \nof the costs associated with buying and selling the assets of the \nfund. The reduction in the value  of the affected assets will be \ndifferent for each fund and is likely to be most significant for the \nproportion of any fund invested in property. \n The reduction for any part of the fund invested with external fund \nmanagers may happen at a different time to the reduction for the \nrest of the fund. \n If we delay a new investment, it will be based on the unit price at \nthe end of the period.\n3.11  You may be able eligible to claim income tax relief on \ncontributions into this PRSA.

Unit-linking is simply a way of working \nout the value of your plan on any date. You do not own the \nunits. The plan will be linked to units in one or more of the \nfunds available on this plan. The maximum number of funds \nyou can currently invest in is 10. \n  We can change the funds available on this plan at any stage. \nWe can also close a fund to new contributions or close it \nentirely and move existing customers to other funds open at \nthat time. If you are invested in the closing fund we will give \nyou one months\u2019 notice. It may happen that in order to protect \ncustomers\u2019 fund values we have to close a fund immediately \nwithout any advance notice. In this event we will notify you as \nsoon as possible after the fund closes.  \n5.2  Working out unit prices  \n  We work out the unit prices in all of the funds by using the \nmarket value of the assets of the fund and deducting the fund \ncharge. Unit prices may fall as well as rise. \n  When there are more customers moving out of a fund \nthan making new investments in it or when there are more \ncustomers making new investments in a fund than moving \nout of it, we may reduce the value of the units in the fund to \nreflect a percentage of the costs associated with buying and selling the assets of the fund. The reduction in the value of the \naffected assets will be different for each fund and is likely to \nbe most significant for the proportion of any fund invested in \nproperty. The reduction for any part of the fund invested with \nfund managers may happen at a different time to the reduction \nfor the rest of the fund. \n  Details of how we work out fund prices are in our Fund \nOperating Procedures governing the funds. These are available \nonline at www.irishlife.ie or from the Irish Life Head Office. \n5.3  Securities Lending \n  If you have chosen to invest in a fund that invests in equities or \nbonds, the equities or bonds within that fund may be used for \nthe purpose of securities lending in order to earn an additional \nreturn for the fund. While securities lending increases the level \nof risk within a fund it provides an opportunity to increase the \ninvestment return.\n  Funds which are managed by Irish Life Investment Managers \nmay include securities lending on equities and bonds as part of \nits investment strategy. The aim of securities lending is to earn \nan additional return for the fund(s). Securities lending involves \nthe lending of some assets of the fund to selected financial \ninstitutions. Whilst the objective is to enhance returns to the \nfund, in certain circumstances the fund could suffer a loss if the \nfinancial institution(s) encountered financial difficulties.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "38de5e2f-1e8d-4f0f-abea-bdba8f762f2e": {"__data__": {"id_": "38de5e2f-1e8d-4f0f-abea-bdba8f762f2e", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "50", "file_name": "Clear PRSA 5% - ILA 7652 (REV 07-23).pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "10f300c1-7769-4273-900a-f63c2bdb5af1", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "50", "file_name": "Clear PRSA 5% - ILA 7652 (REV 07-23).pdf"}, "hash": "8f4bc9dd50eacc1998b07ab0dc482b6c2ab10c46b9239d93ae4639774a846103"}}, "hash": "8f4bc9dd50eacc1998b07ab0dc482b6c2ab10c46b9239d93ae4639774a846103", "text": "50\n  Counterparty Risk\n  We are not liable for any loss incurred by any of the \ninvestments in the funds available under this plan. It is \nimportant to note that the value of investments with any fund \nmanager may be affected if any of the institutions with whom \nmoney is placed suffers insolvency or any other financial \ndifficulties. The value of your units will reflect the value of the \nassets recovered from that manager. Irish Life will not use any \nof our assets to make up any shortfall.\n5.4  Fund charges  \n  The current fund charge for all funds available on this plan is \n1%.\n5.5  Use of borrowings  \n  It is possible that some funds use borrowing as part of their \ninvestment strategy. Borrowing increases the risk involved \nin an investment. If the assets fall in value and the fund has \nborrowed, the impact on the value of your fund could be larger \nthan the fall in asset values. Whether this applies is indicated \nin the description of the funds in the fund guide section of this \nbooklet. The amount borrowed will vary and you can contact \nIrish Life to ascertain the current amount borrowed within the \nfund at any given time. This will help you assess the risk level \nwhich increases as borrowing increases. \n5.6  Switching between funds  \n  You may choose to change the funds we place units into \nfor future contributions. You may also choose to switch the \nfunds you are already invested in. You can switch your funds \nonline, over the phone and in writing. We do not charge for these options. The unit prices we use for your switch will be \ndetermined according to our switching policy in place at the \ntime of the switch. Our current policy is to use unit prices \neffective on the same working day we receive your written \nrequest unless your switch is subject to a delay period (see \nbelow). However, we reserve the right to change our switching \npolicy in the future. We advise that you check with Irish Life or \nyour financial adviser as to what our switching policy is at the \ntime you switch.\n  Notice periods \n  In certain circumstances, we may place restrictions on switches \nbetween funds. These restrictions may include, but are not \nlimited to: \n>  Requiring a minimum period of time between switches, \n>  Limiting the amount that may be switched between funds \nat any one time, \n>  Not accepting switch requests from an agent acting for or \non behalf of more than one policyholder. \n  We may need to delay switches in and out of your retirement \nvalue. \n  Once we have been given notice that a switch is to be made \nbetween funds this decision cannot be changed during any \nnotice period. \n  Delayed switches will be based on the value of units at the end \nof the period when the switch actually takes place. \n  Some of the reasons are explained in section 3.10 of these \nterms and conditions.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "059af52a-5708-4ac3-bf37-84a9c2e061e6": {"__data__": {"id_": "059af52a-5708-4ac3-bf37-84a9c2e061e6", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "51", "file_name": "Clear PRSA 5% - ILA 7652 (REV 07-23).pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "ad580579-8644-4a17-9db7-b3fe6aba8550", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "51", "file_name": "Clear PRSA 5% - ILA 7652 (REV 07-23).pdf"}, "hash": "7f8ec8cb2e409a4a240c8353979f30dd26bb2542ae5ccab5f28bc28b3efcd587"}}, "hash": "f886ab67589a374f6af8c3d7117f4dbf74e6db1c5ec821074e70081c3bc547a4", "text": "51\n5.7  Automatic switching between funds   \n  We offer a choice of two Default Investment Strategies which \nhave pre-determined funds selected for the term of your plan.\n  We also offer two Lifestyling Options which allow you to \nchoose your own funds for a certain period after which, your \nfund is automatically switched to pre-determined funds for the \nremaining term of your plan.\n  You can only choose to invest in one of the above options \nat any time and all your contributions will be invested as \nindicated for that strategy.

Time\n We want to be crystal clear that the value of each fund can go \ndown as well as up in value, particularly over shorter periods of \ntime. This  is because the funds are investing in assets such as \nbonds, shares, property, cash and externally managed funds. \nHowever, investing in these types of investments over the long-\nterm could produce better returns than deposit accounts.

Information on how \nother investment managers approach sustainability risks is available on their websites details \nof which have been included on the next page. \nDepending on the relationship with an individual investment manager we also agree the \napproach and criteria used to make investment decisions. The approach to managing \nsustainability risk will be different depending on the asset class and the investment strategy. \nWhere appropriate we have given our investment managers the authority to use voting rights \nand to engage with investee companies on sustainability issues. This helps them to manage \nsustainability risk and deliver more sustainable long-term outcomes. We regularly engage with \nour investment managers to ensure their investment approach continues to meet our needs.\n2. What is the likely impact of sustainability risks on the returns of investment \nproducts available from Irish Life?\n The impacts of a sustainability risk vary depending on the specific risk and asset class. A \nsustainability risk may impact a specific investment fund, it may also impact an economic \nsector or geographical region and so impact underlying investments of the fund. If a \nsustainability risk occurs, there may be a sudden negative impact on the value of an \ninvestment. In extreme circumstances, the value of the full investment may be lost. \nConsidering sustainability risks as part of investment decisions, as explained in section 1 \nabove, helps minimise the risk of this happening.Investment manager \nwebsites:\nILIM:  \nwww.ilim.com/responsible-\ninvesting\nSetanta:  \nhttps://www.setanta-asset.com/\nresponsible-investing/\nAmundi:  \nwww.amundi.com/int/ESG\nFidelity Worldwide Investment:  \nhttps://www.fidelityinstitutional.\ncom/en-gb/sustainable-\ninvesting/sustainable-investing\nDavy:  \nwww.davy.ie/legal/disclosures/\nsustainable-finance.html", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "fe833fa6-e3b4-4fe7-b4bf-5d382dca4692": {"__data__": {"id_": "fe833fa6-e3b4-4fe7-b4bf-5d382dca4692", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "11", "file_name": "FlexInvest - ILA 14674 (REV 12-22).pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "d4a811a0-de8c-4a31-b8de-ac579162beb7", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "11", "file_name": "FlexInvest - ILA 14674 (REV 12-22).pdf"}, "hash": "4b3d3867645496d4104b1f483e816b90982643d3706a4b613b24accf889f56bc"}}, "hash": "0010efe5cbaab4644c9b36827a57038fd92f15cbeb40a23c25e72663b31a23ba", "text": "11\n3.

You should remember that risk and potential return are closely \nlinked. In other words, investments which are higher-risk tend to have higher \nreturns over the long-term, but can also experience higher falls.\nOur volatility scale assumes that all investments are held on a long-term basis. \nIf an investment is held for a short-term, it will usually have a greater level of risk \nthan the volatility scale shows. You can usually reduce the level of risk attached \nto an investment by diversifying (splitting the investment \u2018eggs\u2019 between different \n\u2018baskets\u2019) and leaving the investment where it is for a longer period of time (in \nother words, the longer you hold volatile investments for, the less volatile the \nreturns become).\nThe volatility rating of a fund can change. Therefore the volatility ratings in this \nbooklet may not be the most up-to-date ratings. Please visit our website www.\nirishlife.ie to see the most up-to-date volatility ratings.

This means that you \ndon\u2019t have to worry about a fund becoming a higher risk rating than the one you originally invested in over the longer term.Start year 2:  \nIf, over the course of a year, shares grew in \nvalue by 20%, while bonds and other assets \nor external managers both fell in value by \n10%, without rebalancing, the second  pie \nchart shows the new split of the fund.

It \nuses a many factors to identify long-term stock-market trends and \nmovements. \nThe advantage of having the DSC is that, where used, the strategy \nidentifies greater potential for falls in the stock-market, it aims \nto reduce the amount invested in global shares and increase the \namount in cash. And importantly, when the DSC identifies greater \npotential for stock-market recovery, it will move back out of cash \nand into global shares.\nIt is important to note that the DSC looks at long-term movements \nand trends in the market and is not designed to react to one-off or \nshort-term jumps or shocks. Currently DSC only applies to Global \nShares, ILIM will continually review this and, in the future, a similar \nprocess may apply to other assets.Global low-volatility shares\nThis strategy aims to manage volatility while maintaining share \nmarket returns over the longer-term. The strategy is focussed on \nminimising maximum losses.  ILIM select stocks based on a range \nof low-risk factors and through this stock selection process aim to \nminimise the total potential fall experienced over time.\nOption Strategy\nThe option strategy provides further diversification and aims to \ndeliver a more stable return over time. ILIM will sell put options on \nequity indices with the aim of reducing the impact on the fund of \nups and downs in the stock-market. Whilst the strategy may not \nbenefit from the full increase in equity indices if they rise sharply, it \nis protected from some of the market falls. \nCurrency Hedging\nILIM manage the risk of exposure to foreign currencies in Irish Life \nMAPS by partly hedging any exposure. The strategy aims to reduce \nthe risk of experiencing negative returns from foreign currency \nmoves. This is achieved by partly hedging non-euro currency \nexposure when it is beneficial to do so.\nWarning: These funds may be affected by changes in currency exchange rates.\nWarning: If you invest in this product you may lose some or all of the money you invest.Warning: The value of your investment may go down as well as up.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "1859f697-3141-48b4-9537-8c953f396c37": {"__data__": {"id_": "1859f697-3141-48b4-9537-8c953f396c37", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "23", "file_name": "FlexInvest - ILA 14674 (REV 12-22).pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "03a28c3e-c0ce-43e1-a951-d9ae6d17b2da", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "23", "file_name": "FlexInvest - ILA 14674 (REV 12-22).pdf"}, "hash": "9e22ab84be54e1ff25fabf5190f46fc94cd13646a3583a2fb185c55acb98cbe1"}}, "hash": "9e22ab84be54e1ff25fabf5190f46fc94cd13646a3583a2fb185c55acb98cbe1", "text": "100% of the funds available on this plan are categorised as ESG funds meeting the disclosure provisions in Article 8 of SFDR as at \nNovember 2022.\n0% of the funds available on this plan are categorised as ESG funds meeting the disclosure provisions in Article 9 of SFDR as at \nNovember 2022.\nThese categorisations can chang e, please check irishlife.ie for the most up to date categorisations.FUND DESCRIPTIONS\nMAPS Conservative (Series R)  \n(VOLATILITY IL3) \nThis fund invests in a mix of assets such as bonds, shares, \nproperty, cash and externally managed funds.

Smart \nInvest does not collect the information required for tax reporting for \nUS citizens. It also does not facilitate the additional due diligence \nnecessary to accept investments into FlexInvest from a politically \nexposed person (PEP) or a relative or close associate of a PEP . \nCan I cash in part of my Flexinvest?\nYes, you can cash in part of your FlexInvest at any stage. You must \ncash in at least \u20ac20 (after tax), and the value of your investment after \nyou cash in any of your plan must be at least \u20ac10. You will have to \npay tax on any investment returns you make. \nCan I switch funds?\nNo, you can\u2019t switch funds on your FlexInvest plan.\nWhat tax do I pay?\nUnder current Irish tax law, you must pay tax on any returns you \nmake in your FlexInvest plan. The tax rate is currently 41%. We will \npay you the amount remaining after tax.\nWe will pay this tax (if it is due):\n> when you cash in all or part of your plan;\n> when you die;\n> every 8th anniversary from the start of your plan. Where tax \nis deducted from your fund on each 8th anniversary, this tax can be offset against any tax that is payable on a subsequent \nencashment.\nYou may also have to pay tax on funds that invest in property \noutside Ireland. Under current UK tax law, income received from \nrent on UK property investments is subject to tax, after certain \nexpenses and interest payments. \nThe current rate is 20% (as at November 2022). This tax will be \ntaken from the fund and reflected in the fund\u2019s value.\nFor the investments in European property, tax will be deducted \non rental profit if this is required by the domestic tax rules of the \nrelevant country. In some instances, depending on the domestic \ntax rules of the country, capital gains tax may also be payable on \ncapital gains made within the fund. Any tax due will be deducted \nfrom the fund and thus reflected in the fund performance. If tax \nlegislation and practice changes during the term, this will be \nreflected in the fund value.\nThis information is based on current tax law (November 2022) \nwhich could change in the future.\nLife Insurance Levy\nWe will collect any government taxes or levies and pass them \ndirectly to the Revenue Commissioners. The current government \nlevy on life insurance payments is 1%.\nYour investment amount is the total amount you have paid less \nthe levy that has been deducted.

There will be charges taken from these \nfunds by both us and these external managers.\nFor these funds, it is important to note the value of any investment \nplaced with these managers may be affected if any of the \ninstitutions with whom we place money suffers insolvency or other \nfinancial difficulty. Our commitment is to pass on the full value of \nthe assets we receive from the external manager for your plan. Our \ncommitment is restricted to the amounts we actually receive from \nthe external manager.When you invest in funds managed by an external fund manager, it \nis likely that the way your investment performs in those funds using \nour products will be slightly different from the performance of the \nexternal manager funds themselves. This could be due to factors \nsuch as the time needed to move your investment into their funds \nand any changes in the values of currencies (please see Currency \nsection below).\nWhere funds are managed by external fund managers, the \ninvestments may be legally held in countries other than Ireland. \nYou should be aware that where a fund is domiciled will impact on \nhow it is regulated.\nVariable Fund Charges\nWe won\u2019t increase the charges outlined earlier unless we need to \nbecause of an increase in the costs of dealing with the investment.\nHowever, the charges on the Multi-Asset Portfolio Funds are \nvariable which means they can be higher or lower than the charges \nshown in this booklet.\nThe charges on a fund may also vary if that fund can invest in a range \nof other funds.

It is important to note that the \nvalue of investments with any fund manager may be affected if any \nof the institutions with whom money is placed suffers insolvency or \nany other financial difficulties. The value of your units will reflect the \nvalue of the assets recovered from that manager. We will not use any \nof our assets to make up any shortfall.\nNotice period (delays)\nIn certain circumstances, we may delay withdrawals out of a fund. \nThis is referred to as the \u2018notice period\u2019 . This may be because there \nare practical problems buying or selling the assets within the fund \nor if an external manager who is responsible for the investment of \nany part of the fund imposes such a delay. Delayed transactions will \nbe based on the value of units at the end of the period when the \ntransaction actually takes place. If you have invested in a property \nfund, a significant delay would be likely to apply, depending on the \nnature of the underlying assets. This delay will be no more than 18 \nmonths.  Once you have given us notice that you want to withdraw \nfrom a fund, you cannot change your mind during any notice period. \nSwitching between funds\nPlease note that you can\u2019t currently switch between funds on your \nFlexInvest plan.\nCurrency\nFunds investing outside the eurozone\nFunds that invest outside of the eurozone carry a risk related to \ncurrency. This is because the funds are priced in euro but the assets in which the fund invests are valued in their local currency. This can \nreduce your returns depending upon how those local currencies are \nperforming compared with the euro.\nFor example, Multi-Asset Portfolio Funds may invest a portion in UK \ncompanies\u2019 shares. Since the shares are priced in pounds sterling, the \nvalue of the Multi-Asset Portfolio Fund could be affected both by how \nthe shares of the companies perform and any movements in the euro \nand sterling exchange rate. If, for example, there has been no change \nin the value of the shares in sterling, but sterling falls in value against \nthe euro, the Multi-Asset Portfolio Fund could fall in value. Obviously, \nin the same circumstances, a rise in the value of sterling could result \nin an increase in the value of the Multi-Asset Portfolio Fund. Some \nfunds which invest in assets outside of the eurozone may try to \nmanage the risk related to movements in exchange rates. The cost \nof trying to protect against currency movements will be charged to \nthe fund on an on-going basis. Changes in exchange rates during the \ninvestment term in funds which are not protected against currency \nmovements may have a negative effect on the value of these funds \nand the expected investment returns.\nEqually, some fund managers will try not to manage the risk related \nto movements in exchange rates and the value of your investment \nwill be fully exposed to exchange rate movements.\nReducing the value of the fund\nWhen there are more customers moving out of a fund than making \nnew investments in it, we may reduce the value of the units in the \nfund to reflect the percentage of the costs associated with buying \nand selling the assets of the fund. The reduction is likely to be most \nsignificant for the percentage of any fund invested in property.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "f742de54-d232-4c38-acdd-8844cc2ad470": {"__data__": {"id_": "f742de54-d232-4c38-acdd-8844cc2ad470", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "30", "file_name": "FlexInvest - ILA 14674 (REV 12-22).pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "cb1dd5c5-3b5e-4001-8944-fc83d3a59e48", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "30", "file_name": "FlexInvest - ILA 14674 (REV 12-22).pdf"}, "hash": "562a8c74fe7b538783e16dfbc7797192517898a7a75fe9ad7aab013526d735f1"}}, "hash": "562a8c74fe7b538783e16dfbc7797192517898a7a75fe9ad7aab013526d735f1", "text": "30\nIncentive fees\nAn incentive fee may be paid to the fund \nmanagers if they achieve positive investment \nreturns on the funds they manage.

Make sure the policy meets your needs!\n FlexInvest is a lump-sum investment plan which aims to meet \nyour medium to long term investment requirements. We \nrecommend that you consider FlexInvest as an investment for a \nterm of at least five years. \n Unless you are fully satisfied as to the nature of this commitment \nhaving regard to your needs, resources and circumstances, \nyou should not enter into this commitment. This investment \ndoes not replace in whole or in part an existing investment with \nIrish Life or with any other insurer which has been or is to be \ncancelled or reduced.\n2.  What happen if you want to cash in the \npolicy early or stop paying premiums?\n The minimum partial withdrawal is \u20ac20 after tax.\n In certain circumstances, we may delay encashments. This may \nbe because there are a large number of customers wishing to \nput money in or encash their fund or part of their fund at the \nsame time, or if there are practical problems buying or selling the \nassets within the fund or if a fund manager who is responsible \nfor the investment of any part of the fund imposes a delay or if \nyou invest in markets or funds with assets with significant time \ndifferences including trading or settlement time differences e.g. \nAsian markets. Due to the high cost and time involved in buying or selling \nproperties, a delay of this sort is most likely to happen if you are \ninvested in a property fund (or a fund with a high proportion of \nproperty or property related assets). The length of any delay will \ndepend on how long it takes us to buy or sell the assets in the \nfund. A significant delay would be likely to apply in this situation. \nThis delay will be no more than 18 months. Delayed transactions \nwill be based on the value of units at the end of the delay period \nwhen the transaction actually takes place.\n When there are more customers moving out of a fund than \nmaking new investments in it, or there are more customers \nmaking new investments than moving out of the fund, we may \nreduce the value of the units in the fund to reflect the percentage \nof the costs associated with buying and selling the assets of the \nfund. The reduction in the value of the affected assets will be \ndifferent for each fund and is likely to be most significant for the \nproportion of any fund invested in property. The reduction for \nany part of the fund invested with fund managers may happen at \na different time to the reduction for the rest of the fund.\n The value of your investment may go down as well as up. \nTherefore your cash-in value may be less than the payments \nyou have made.

Information on taxation issues\n Any taxes or levies imposed by the government will be collected \nby Irish Life and passed directly to the Revenue Commissioners.\n Under current Irish tax law (November 2022), tax is payable on \nany returns made on this plan. Any growth on your investment \namount, is considered as a return earned by you and so is \nsubject to tax (where tax is applicable).  The tax rate is currently \n41%.

Where tax is \ndeducted from your fund on each 8th anniversary, this tax can \nbe offset against any tax that is payable on a subsequent full \nencashment.Any tax due will be taken from the fund and be reflected in the \nfund\u2019s value. If tax legislation and practice changes during the \nterm, this will be reflected in the fund value.\nIrish tax legislation means Irish Life must deduct the correct \namount of tax payable. Irish Life retains absolute discretion \nto determine, in accordance with all relevant legislation and \nguidelines, its application and interpretation, the tax treatment \nof this investment.\nIn some circumstances, additional tax may be due after death. \nFor example, if the death benefit is paid to your estate, your \nbeneficiaries may have to pay inheritance tax. There is no \ninheritance tax due on an inheritance between a married \ncouple or registered civil partners. In certain circumstances \ninheritance tax due may be reduced by any exit tax paid on a \ndeath under this investment.\nPlease contact Irish Life if you do not fully understand the likely \ntax treatment of any benefits payable in connection with your \ninvestment.\nWe recommend that you seek independent tax advice in \nrespect of your own specific circumstances.\nFunds investing in overseas property or other overseas \nassets \nSome funds invest wholly or partly in property or other assets \noutside of Ireland.  Under current UK tax law, income received \nfrom rent received on UK property investments is subject to tax, \nafter certain expenses and interest payments.

Additional information in relation to your \npolicy\n What are the benefits and options provided under this plan?\n FlexInvest is an investment which aims to meet your medium to \nlong term investment requirements.

In return for your money \nwe allocate units to FlexInvest from your chosen fund on your \ninvestment schedule. The value of your investment is linked \nto the value of these units. The value of a unit may go down as \nwell as up over time, depending on how the underlying assets \nperform. The underlying assets in the fund may be used for the \npurposes of securities lending in order to earn an additional \nreturn for the fund. While securities lending increases the level \nof risk within a fund, it also provides an opportunity to increase \nthe investment return. Where a fund manager engages in \nsecurities lending, they may keep some or all of the revenue \nfrom this activity for themselves. Funds which are managed by \nIrish Life Investment Managers will include securities lending \non equities and bonds as part of its investment strategy. The \naim of securities lending is to earn an additional return for \nthe fund(s). Securities lending involves the lending of some \nassets of the fund to selected financial institutions. Whilst \nthe objective is to enhance returns to the fund, in certain \ncircumstances the fund could suffer a loss if the financial \ninstitution(s) encountered financial difficulties.\n You do not own the units. Unit-linking is simply a method of \nworking out the value of your investment at any date. The gross \nvalue of your investment at any date will be equal to the total \nof the number of units allocated to your investment from each \nfund multiplied by the unit price for units of that fund on that \ndate. The value of your investment will therefore go down as \nwell as up over time as the unit prices change to reflect the \nvalue of the underlying assets.\n Variable charges\nFunds are administered at an overall level by Irish Life. For some \nfunds, a part or all of the assets are managed by companies (fund \nmanagers) other than Irish Life.  There are charges taken from these \nfunds by both Irish Life and these fund managers.\nThe fund managers take their costs and charges from the assets \nthey manage. These charges are reflected in how the funds \nperform.\nThe level of the charges as a percentage of the overall fund can \nvary for several reasons.\n> The first reason is the fact that the charges on the overall fund \nwill vary according to the proportion of the fund invested in \neach of the underlying funds and the specific charges for these \nfunds. The underlying funds may also change in the future and \ndifferent charges for the new funds may lead to overall fund \ncharge changing. \n> The second reason is that the costs associated with managing \na fund may vary and change over time.  These costs include, \nfor example, license fees where funds track a particular index, \nlegal, accounting and marketing costs.\n> The third reason is that some funds may borrow to increase \nthe amount of assets that the funds can invest in. Borrowing \nincreases the chance of achieving improved returns if the \nassets perform well. However, it also increases the level of risk \nof the investment. The fund managers\u2019 charges in relation to \ninvestments are based on the total value of the assets held \nincluding any borrowings made rather than on the funds \nthey manage.

For example, a significant fall in asset values could result \nin a significant increase in the average level of this charge as a \npercentage of funds managed. This is because a fall in asset values \nmeans that the amounts borrowed would represent a higher \nproportion of the fund value.\nEqually, if the level of borrowing reduces relative to the value of \nassets, then the level of charges as a percentage of funds managed \nwould also reduce. For example, a significant rise in asset values \ncould result in a significant decrease in the average level of this \ncharge as a percentage of funds managed.

An example of this is Asian markets.  \nDue to the high cost and time involved in buying properti es, a \ndelay of this sort is most likely to happen if you are investing in a \nproperty fund (or a fund with a high proportion of property or \nproperty related assets). The length of any delay will depend on \nhow long it takes us to buy the assets in the fund. A significant \ndelay  would be likely to apply in this situation.

We take this charge from the unit \nprice in your fund evenly over the month. This charge goes towards \nthe costs of:  \n\u2022 setting up and administering the investment; and \n\u2022 the expenses of managing your investment.  \nThe yearly fund charges on the FlexInvest  funds are as follows:  \nPanel of funds  Standard \nCharge  Estimated \naverage  \nlevel of   \nvariable \ncharge  Total     \nestimated \nfund \ncharge \neach year  \nMAPS Conservative  \n(Series R)  1.10 % 0.15%  1.25% \nMAPS Balanced  (Series R)  1.10 % 0.15%  1.25% \nMAPS Experienced  \n(Series R)  1.10 % 0.15%  1.25% \n \nThe estimated average levels of variable charges indicated above are \nthose expected over the long -term. The actual level of charges may be higher or lower than this. The section on variable charges below \nexplains the reasons for this.  \n \n3.1 Variable Charges  \nAs noted above the charge on the available  funds can vary and \ntherefore is not fixed throughout the lifetime of your plan.  \nThe charge noted in the above table reflects our best estimate of the \ntotal charges we expect will be incurred by the fund over the long \nterm. However, the actual charges you incur may vary for the \nreasons given below.  \nFunds with variable charges   \nFunds are administered at an overall level by Irish Life. For some funds, \na part or all of the assets are managed by compa nies (external \nmanagers) other than Irish Life. There are charges taken from these \nfunds by both Irish Life and these fund managers.  \nThe fund managers take their costs and charges from the assets they \nmanage. These charges are reflected in how the funds pe rform. The \nlevel of the charges they take, as a percentage of the overall fund, can \nvary for several reasons.  \n\u2022 The first reason is the fact that the  charges on the overall fund \nwill vary according to the  proportion  of the fund  invested in \neach of the underl ying funds and the specific charges for \nthese funds.  The underlying funds may also change in the \nfuture and different charges for the new funds may lead to \noverall fund charge changing . \n\u2022 The second reason is that the costs associated with managing \na fund may vary and change over time.

Borrowing \nincreases the chance of achieving improved returns if the assets \nperform well. However, it also increases the level of risk of the \ninvestment. The fund  managers\u2019  charges in relation to \ninvestments are based on the total value of the assets held \nincluding any borrowings made rather than on the funds they \nmanage. The level of these charges as a percentage of the funds \nmanaged will depend on the amount of borrowing relative to \nthe value of the assets h eld.  \nIf the level of borrowing increases by more than the value of \nassets, the level of charges as a percentage of funds managed  \nwould increase. For example, a  significant fall in asset values \ncould result in a significant increase in the average level of  this \ncharge as a percentage of funds managed. This is because a fall \nin asset values means that the amounts borrowed would \nrepresent a higher percentage of the fund value.  \nEqually, if the level of borrowing reduces by more than the value \nof assets, then the level of charges as a percentage of funds \nmanaged would also reduce. For example, a significant rise in \nasset values could result in a significant reduction in the average \nlevel of this charge as a percentage of the funds managed. This \nis because a ris e in asset values means that the amounts \nborrowed would represent a lower percentage of the fund \nvalue.  \nTaking account of these factors, we estimate that the estimated \naverage level of charges on the funds will be split as on the previous table. The actual  level of the estimated fund  manager variable charge, \nand therefore the total expected charge, may be higher or lower than \nthis depending on the factors outlined above.  \n \n3.2 Additional points to note  \nCounterparty Risk  \nWe are not liable for any loss incurred by any of the  investments in \nthe funds available under this plan. It is important to note that the \nvalue of investments with any fund manager may be affected if any \nof the institutions with whom money is placed suffers insolvency or \nany other fina ncial difficulties. The value of your units will reflect \nthe value of the assets recovered from that manager. Irish Life  will \nnot use any of our assets to make up any shortfall . \nCurrency  \nCertain funds contain assets which are invested outside of the Euro \nzone. The fund managers may use currency protection against any \nchanges in the value of those currencies against the Euro. The cost of \nany currency protection used is charged to your fund.  Where the fund \nmanager has not used currency protection, there  is a risk that your \nplan value will be adversely affected by changes in currency exchange \nrates.   \nExternal Funds  \nWhere a fund invests in an external fund, we will represent the key \nfeatures of the external fund in our literature. However, the \nmanagers of external funds may retain discretion over the nature \nand choice of assets, custodians and institutions with whom they \nplace money and expenses incurred, within any part of a fund they \nmanage.

It is not marketing material. The\ninformation is required by law to help you understand the nature, risks, costs, potential gains and losses of this product\nand help you compare it with other products.\n Product\nClear Invest with the Multi Asset Portfolio Fund 5, manufactured by Irish Life Assurance plc\n(www.irishlife.ie). If you would like further information on this product you can call us on 01 704 1010.\nIrish Life Assurance plc is regulated by the Central Bank of Ireland. This document was produced on 31 May 2021.\nYou are about to purchase a product that is not simple and may be difficult to understand.\n What is this product?\nType: Clear Invest is a lump sum life insurance investment plan. Your investment is used to buy units in the Multi Asset\nPortfolio Fund 5. The value of your investment is then linked to the value of the units in this fund, and may go down as\nwell as up over time.\nObjectives: This fund invests in a mix of assets such as bonds, shares, property, cash and externally managed funds. It\nalso features several risk management strategies. The fund may use derivatives to achieve the fund's investment\nobjective, reduce risk or to manage the fund more efficiently. The fund aims to have a relatively high percentage invested\nin higher risk assets such as shares and property. The fund manager monitors and rebalances the fund regularly and may\nchange the asset mix and risk management strategies over time.\nIntended retail investor: This investment might suit you if you want to invest \u20ac10,000 or more and you are prepared to\nstay invested for at least 5 years to give your investment time to achieve its growth potential. There is no maturity date on\nthis product. As with all investment funds the value of your investment can go up and down, particularly over shorter\nperiods of time. So you could get back less than you put in. This product is available to anyone living in the Republic of\nIreland and aged between 18 and 74.\nInsurance benefits and costs: If you die while you have your plan, Irish Life will pay 100.10% of the value of your fund,\nless the appropriate tax. There is no extra charge for this benefit.\n What are the risks and what could I get in return?\nRisk Indicator\nThe risk indicator assumes you keep the product\nfor 7 years.\nThe summary risk indicator is a guide to the level of risk of this product compared to other products. It shows how likely it\nis that the product will lose money because of movements in the markets or because we are not able to pay you.\nWe have classified this product as 3 out of 7, which is a medium-low risk class. This rates the potential losses from future\nperformance at a medium-low level.\nThis product does not include any protection against future market performance so you could lose some or all of your\ninvestment.\nThe assets in this fund may be used for the purposes of securities lending in order to earn an additional return for the\nfund. While securities lending increases the level of risk within the fund it also provides an opportunity to increase the\ninvestment return. Part of this fund may borrow to invest in property. Borrowing increases the chance of achieving\nimproved returns if the assets perform well. However, it also may mean greater losses if the assets fall in value. Non euro\ncurrency exposures may be fully or partly hedged back to euro to reduce foreign currency risk.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "133b13bb-5637-4c53-8574-e1ade73d3577": {"__data__": {"id_": "133b13bb-5637-4c53-8574-e1ade73d3577", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "2", "file_name": "Key Info Clear Invest MAP5.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "cd169d37-2bcf-4ac6-a6b0-169b3275997a", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "2", "file_name": "Key Info Clear Invest MAP5.pdf"}, "hash": "c65213b0486a0156f1292f40f7636eaa3904bf53f612505cec15bcc9afb11353"}}, "hash": "c65213b0486a0156f1292f40f7636eaa3904bf53f612505cec15bcc9afb11353", "text": "Performance Scenarios\nInvestment\n    \u20ac10,000 1 year 4 years7  years\n(Recommended\nholding period)\nSurvival Scenarios\nStress scenario What you might get back after costs \u20ac4,162 \u20ac6,824 \u20ac6,106\nAverage return each year -58.38% -9.11% -6.81%\nUnfavourable scenario What you might get back after costs \u20ac8,886 \u20ac9,843 \u20ac11,008\nAverage return each year -11.14% -0.40% 1.38%\nModerate scenario What you might get back after costs \u20ac9,989 \u20ac12,413 \u20ac14,952\nAverage return each year -0.11% 5.55% 5.92%\nFavourable scenario What you might get back after costs \u20ac11,175 \u20ac15,579 \u20ac20,211\nAverage return each year 11.75% 11.72% 10.57%\n Death Scenario\n Death benefit                  What your beneficiaries might get back after costs \u20ac10,525 \u20ac12,551 \u20ac14,967\nThe table shows the money you could get back over the next 7 years, under different scenarios, assuming that you invest\n\u20ac10,000. The scenarios shown illustrate how your investment could perform. You can compare them with the scenarios of\nother products. The death benefit shown represents the death benefit that would be paid under the moderate scenario.\nThe scenarios presented are an estimate of future performance based on evidence from the past on how the value of this\ninvestment varies, and are not an exact indicator. What you get will vary depending on how the market performs and how\nlong you keep the product.

This tax is not included in the figures shown. The tax rate on\nreturns is currently 41%.\nMarket developments in the future cannot be accurately predicted. The performance scenarios are based on the\npast performance of the fund for a period of up to 5 years. You should be aware that, where there has been very\ngood investment performance over this period, the performance scenarios (other than the stress scenario) will\nshow very good future returns but where there has been poor investment performance over this period, the\nperformance scenarios will change and show a lower range of potential future returns.\n What happens if Irish Life Assurance plc is unable to pay out?\nIrish Life Assurance plc (Irish Life) is part of the Great-West Lifeco group of companies - one of the world\u00a9s leading and\nmost secure life assurance organisations.

These range from lower risk, Multi Asset Portfolio 2 (MAP2), which has a large percentage invested in \ncash and bonds to higher risk Multi Asset Portfolio 6 (MAP6), which is predominantly invested in shares.\nAs most of us know, investing in shares over long periods of time usually produces better returns than investing in cash or bonds. \nHowever, alongside these higher returns, investing in shares usually brings higher risk and the possibility that returns can vary \nconsiderably each year. Returns can even be negative over a given period of time, especially over shorter periods.\nSo while we might expect MAP6 to give a better return than MAP2 over long periods, we would also expect the returns on MAP6 \nto vary to a much greater extent than those on MAP2.

This means that for \nMAP4 an average return of 2-3% \nwould be a more likely outcome. POSSIBLE  ANNUAL RETURNS  OVER  A  7-YEAR  PERIOD\nThis graph shows the range of possible returns you may expect over a 7-year period for each of the Irish Life MAPS funds.\n95% of the time, the average yearly return over a 7-year period is expected to be within the range of the green bars shown.\nThis means that 5% of the time the average yearly return could be higher or lower than the bars shown.\nThe possible return numbers are produced by Irish Life Investment Managers (ILIM). The returns are calculated before \nperformance fees, taxes and product charges. They allow for a management charge of 1.15% (1.05% for MAP6). The actual fund \nmanagement charge and product charge will depend on your plan. Please see your Product Booklet or Fund Guide for details.

That\u2019s why planning ahead with protection is so \nimportant.\nIf you die during the term of your plan, whatever is left of your \nmortgage will be paid off, as long as your mortgage repayments \nare up to date and your mortgage interest rate has not, on average, \nrisen above the interest rate we have assumed.\nIf you make changes to your cover as outlined in section 4, your \nnew level of cover may not be enough to repay your mortgage in \nfull. \nMortgage life insurance\nNormally, you will transfer ownership of your Mortgage Life \nInsurance plan to your mortgage lender. As you pay off your \nmortgage, your cover will reduce to reflect the reducing amount \nyou owe on your mortgage.\nThe fact that the level of cover reduces over the term of your plan \nhelps to keep the cost of this plan lower than other forms of life \nassurance.\nThe payments and benefits under this plan are guaranteed. That \nmeans you will always know how much you are paying and how much we will pay out. The amount of life cover you need and the \nlength of time you should be protected for will depend on the \namount of your mortgage and how long you have left to pay it off.\nWho will the life cover protect?\nThere are three options for Mortgage Life Insurance and who you \ncan protect. You can protect:\n1. yourself (single cover), which means we will make the payment \nif you die during the term of the plan; or\n2. yourself and your partner (dual cover), which means that we \ncould make the payment twice, once if you die within the term \nof the plan and once if your partner also dies within the term of \nthe plan; or\n3. yourself and your partner (joint cover), which means that we \nwill make the payment if you or your partner dies (whoever \ndies first) during the term of the plan. This means we will only \npay once. \nWhen you take out life cover, your children are automatically \ncovered also.

Information on taxation issues\n Under current Irish tax law (July 2023), tax does not usually have \nto be paid on life cover or specified illness cover benefits, but \nin some circumstances tax may be due.

The only form \nof skin cancer that we cover is malignant \nmelanoma which has been classified as \nbeing a \u2018Clark level 2\u2019 or greater. Clark\u2019s \nsystem is an internationally recognised \nmethod of classifying skin melanomas and \nuses a scale of 1 to 5. A Clark level 1 reflects \na very early melanoma which carries a \nfavourable long-term outlook. \n Early stage thyroid cancer is very treatable, \nand the prognosis for patients with \nthese early stage thyroid cancers is very \ngood.  The TNM classification system is \ninternationally recognised and used as a \nmethod of staging or measuring a tumour. \nThe \u2018T\u2019 element relates to the primary \ntumour and is graded on a scale of 1 to 4.  \n1 represents a small tumour restricted to \nthe organ.

It \nsupplies blood containing oxygen to other \narteries. The aorta can become narrow \n(often because of a build-up of fatty acids \non its walls) or it may become weakened \nbecause of a split (dissection) in the internal \nwall. The aorta may also weaken because \nof an \u2018aneurysm\u2019 which means that the \nartery wall becomes thin and expands.  A \nstent graft might be necessary to bypass the \nnarrowed or weakened part of the artery.\nEndovascular repair involves a surgeon \npassing a catheter (a flexible plastic tube) \nthrough small incisions in a distal artery, \nthrough the blood vessels to the site of the \naneurysm. The catheter delivers a stent \ngraft (a fabric tube held in place by metal \nwire stents) to the site of the aneurysm \nwhere it is put in position in the affected \nsegment of the aorta.  The stent graft acts \nlike a sleeve against the walls of the aorta to \nreinforce the weakened area allowing blood \nto pass through it without pushing on the \naneurysm.2 Brain abscess drained via craniotomy \nPlan definition:\n We will make a limited payment for \nspecified illness cover if a life assured \nundergoes the surgical drainage of an \nintracerebral abscess within the brain tissue \nthrough a craniotomy by a Consultant \nNeurosurgeon. There must be evidence \nof an intracerebral abscess on CT or MRI \nimaging.\nIn simpler terms:\nA brain abscess results from an infection \nin the brain. Swelling and inflammation \ndevelop in response to the infection. \nInfected brain cells, white blood cells and \norganisms collect in an area of the brain, a \nmembrane forms and creates the abscess. \nWhile this immune response can protect the \nbrain from the infection, an abscess may put \npressure on delicate brain tissue. \nA craniotomy is a surgical operation in \nwhich part of the skull is removed in order \nto access the brain. \nYou can claim if you are diagnosed with \nan intracerebral abscess which is treated \nby surgical drainage by craniotomy by a \nConsultant Neurosurgeon. A craniotomy \nis a surgical operation in which part of the \nskull is removed in order to access the brain. \n3.

Also, there is a risk of heart failure due to \nthe increased volume of blood returned to \nthe heart. \nYou can claim if you have surgery, \nstereotactic radiosurgery, or endovascular \ntreatment using coils under the care of a \nconsultant neurologist or radiologist, as \nappropriate, to treat a cerebral AVM or AV \nfistula. \nStereotactic radiosurgery is a form of \nradiation therapy that focuses on a small \narea of the body.

For example, if \nthe life cover is paid to your estate, your beneficiaries may \nhave to pay inheritance tax (there is no inheritance tax due on \nan inheritance between a married couple or registered civil \npartners).\n Any taxes or levies imposed by the government will be collected \nby Irish Life and passed directly to the Revenue Commissioners.\n Where the plan is owned by a company or where payments \nare made by anyone other than the legal owner of the plan, for \nexample from a company or business account, there may be \ntax implications. In these circumstances we recommend that a \nfinancial adviser be consulted regarding any possible taxation \nimplications. \n Please contact your Financial Adviser or your tax adviser if you \ndo not fully understand the likely tax treatment of any benefits \npayable in connection with OnePlan Protection\n We recommend that you seek independent tax advice in respect \nof your own specific circumstances.38", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "eaf94f69-dca5-455d-94af-5b9276ab7dd6": {"__data__": {"id_": "eaf94f69-dca5-455d-94af-5b9276ab7dd6", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "39", "file_name": "One Plan Booklet - ILA 12169 (REV 08-23).pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "b737b3c1-595f-4fdd-bf33-1298955d3a75", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "39", "file_name": "One Plan Booklet - ILA 12169 (REV 08-23).pdf"}, "hash": "77cf1c0c7eb346517f311d442ee0fa7c521b15672c44f31076413e6de787e2e8"}}, "hash": "8b0e7ddc80b7a8707e62c192294b7c6d57f4d8b84b77d76f8fb19ad70229f918", "text": "39\n8.

Our approach to the integration of sustainability risk in investment decisions\nIrish Life Investment Managers Ltd. (ILIM) and Setanta Asset Management Ltd. (Setanta) manage most of the funds we offer on our \nproducts. ILIM and Setanta are related companies, within the same group as Irish Life Assurance. We also offer customers a range of \nfunds managed by external investment managers. \nILA relies on its investment managers, and ILIM and Setanta in particular, to consider sustainability risks, where appropriate, when \nmaking investment decisions. ILIM and Setanta have policies to consider sustainability risks as part of their investment processes. \nILIM and Setanta believe that considering sustainability risk is in the best interest of their clients. Both firms have a Responsible \nInvestment Committee overseeing this area. Information on how other investment managers approach sustainability risks is availabl e \non their websites details of which have been included below.\nDepending on the relationship with an individual investment manager we also agree the approach and criteria used to make \ninvestment decisions. The approach to managing sustainability risk will be different depending on the asset class and the investment \nstrategy. Where appropriate we have given our investment managers the authority to use voting rights and to engage with investee \ncompanies on sustainability issues. This helps them to manage risk and deliver more sustainable long term outcomes. We regularly \nengage with our investment managers to ensure their investment approach continues to meet our needs. \n2. What is the likely impact of sustainability risks on the returns of investment  \n     products available from Irish Life?\nThe impacts of a sustainability risk vary depending on the specific risk and asset class. A sustainability risk may impact a specific \ninvestment fund, it may also impact an economic sector or geographical region and so impact underlying investments of the fund. \nIf a sustainability risk occurs, there may be a sudden negative impact on the value of an investment. In extreme circumstances, the \nvalue of the full investment may be lost. Considering sustainability risks as part of investment decisions, as explained in section 1 \nabove, helps minimise the risk of this happening.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "9e7feba0-8767-42dc-8e62-d20beee785dd": {"__data__": {"id_": "9e7feba0-8767-42dc-8e62-d20beee785dd", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "2", "file_name": "SFDR Flyer 2.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "6ae23591-160a-4ae4-80a3-c08c77d321e1", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "2", "file_name": "SFDR Flyer 2.pdf"}, "hash": "43ad7ae37c94ed69d2d0b3fc97277a2cbda751ded29f3600082c2dc6eabc84db"}}, "hash": "43ad7ae37c94ed69d2d0b3fc97277a2cbda751ded29f3600082c2dc6eabc84db", "text": "3.

ILIM will do this to achieve the overall fund \nobjective and the fund\u2019s sustainability goals. \nDifferent approaches will be used to manage sustainability risks depending on the asset class or strategy.For equity and credit \ninvestments, this may involve excluding or reducing investment in companies with poorer sustainability characteristics and increasi ng \ninvestment in companies with better sustainability characteristics. Alternatively, it may involve ILIM managing a fund against a \nspecified index which itself aims to promote environmental or social characteristics. ILIM will use its voting rights and engage with \ninvestee companies on sustainability issues, if appropriate. \nFor property investments sustainability characteristics are considered when choosing properties and in the ongoing management of \nthe property portfolio.\nWhere funds are managed externally we consider sustainability characteristics as part of the regular due diligence process for these \nfund managers. \nBelow is a list of external investment managers\u2019 ESG funds, you can find more information about these on their websites. \nAmundi Asset Management \n\u2022 Amundi Absolute Return Multi-Strategy Fund\n\u2022 Amundi Multi-Asset Sustainable Future Fund\n\u2022 Amundi Euroland Equity Small Cap Fund\n\u2022 Amundi European Equity Conservative Fund \n\u2022 Amundi Global ESG Ecology Equity Fund\nDavy  \n\u2022 Davy Global Brands Fund\n\u2022 Davy Conservative Income and Growth Fund\nFidelity Worldwide Investment \n\u2022 Fidelity World Fund\n\u2022 Fidelity India Fund\nINVESTMENT MANAGER WEBSITES\nILIM:  www.ilim.com/responsible-investing\nSetanta: https://www.setanta-asset.com/responsible-investing/\nAmundi: https://www.amundi.com/int/ESGDavy: https://www.davygfm.com/asset-management\nFidelity Worldwide Investment - https://www.fidelityinstitutional.com/en-gb/sustainable-investing/sustainable-investing\nIrish Life Assurance plc, Registered in Ireland number 152576, VAT number 9F55923G.\nIrish Life Assurance plc is regulated by the Central Bank of Ireland\nILA 15921 (NPI 03-21)", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "5b36afdc-63f7-4a3d-99e2-ff90297d598c": {"__data__": {"id_": "5b36afdc-63f7-4a3d-99e2-ff90297d598c", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "1", "file_name": "SFDR Flyer.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "8cdcb483-05a3-4eba-99db-ab9fa0c5fc82", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "1", "file_name": "SFDR Flyer.pdf"}, "hash": "1bd9b10affc515ac815756205502023ab831455c23f4f117015e3f6e7a269ff0"}}, "hash": "1bd9b10affc515ac815756205502023ab831455c23f4f117015e3f6e7a269ff0", "text": "Irish Life Financial Services (ILFS) is \nauthorised as an insurance intermediary \nby the Central Bank of Ireland.\nIn this document when we say \u2018we\u2019 or \u2018our\u2019 we\u2019re \nreferring to Irish Life Financial Services.\nWhen we say \u2018sustainability risk\u2019 here we mean an \nenvironmental, social or governance (ESG) event or \ncondition that could cause an actual or a potential \nnegative impact on the value of a product we \nrecommend to you. \nILFS provides advice on products provided by Irish \nLife Assurance (ILA).

Make sure the policy meets your needs!\n The Term Life Insurance plan is a regular payment term \nassurance plan. The plan provides protection benefits only i.e. \nlife cover, specified illness cover and also a number of optional \nprotection benefits over a fixed term. If you opt for the indexation \noption the level of benefits will automatically increase each year. \nThe payment you make will also increase each year. Currently, \nthe rate of increase for benefits is 3% each year and the rate of \nincrease for the payment is 4.5% each year. \n You are entering into a commitment to make a regular payment \nover a relatively long term. Unless you are fully satisfied as to \nthe nature of this commitment having regard to your needs, \nresources and circumstances, you should not enter into this \ncommitment.\n Your Financial Adviser must indicate whether paragraph a) or \nparagraph b) below applies.\na)   This plan replaces in whole or in part an existing plan with Irish \nLife, or with another insurer. Your Financial Adviser will advise \nyou as to the financial consequences of such replacement and of \npossible financial loss as a result.\n You will be asked at the beginning of your application form to \nconfirm this in writing. Please ensure that you have completed \nthis section of the form and that you are satisfied with the \nexplanations provided by your Financial Adviser before you \ncomplete the rest of the application form.b)  This plan does not replace in whole or in part an existing plan \nwith Irish Life or with any other insurer.\n2.  What happens if you want to cash in the \npolicy early or stop paying premiums\n The plan does not acquire a cash or surrender value at any stage.\n If you stop making payments, all cover under the plan will end \nand we may refund a portion of your most recent monthly \npayment so that you will only be charged for the number of days \nthat have passed since that payment. Any payments before your \nmost recent payment will not be refunded.\n3.

In these circumstances we recommend that a \nfinancial adviser be consulted regarding any possible taxation \nimplications.\n Please contact your Financial Adviser or Irish Life if you do not \nfully understand the likely tax treatment of any benefits payable \nin connection with your Term Life Insurance plan.\n However, we recommend that you seek independent tax advice \nin respect of your own specific circumstances.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "ceffbb55-4c4a-40b0-9bdd-ec3789db97db": {"__data__": {"id_": "ceffbb55-4c4a-40b0-9bdd-ec3789db97db", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "42", "file_name": "Term Life - ILA 3078 (REV 08-23).pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "10db29d5-6af4-47d5-a082-f02e32c65767", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "42", "file_name": "Term Life - ILA 3078 (REV 08-23).pdf"}, "hash": "5ac329a56a178e9fc0929e23a037e93cb0bed2af362b3eeeeb4bdfa759b930ad"}}, "hash": "ea462d23c07a423d9254e591220fd3eb480ea257b7f85a360cadd20488122f9a", "text": "42\n8.

Aortic aneurysm - with endovascular repair  \n \nPlan definition:  \nWe will make a limited payment for specified illness cover if a \nlife assured undergoes endovascular repair of an aneurysm of \nthe thoracic or abdominal aorta with a graft.  \nFor the above definition the following are not covered:  \n \u2022 Procedures to any branch es of the thoracic and abdominal \naorta.  \n \nIn simpler terms:  \nThe aorta is the main artery of the body. It supplies blood \ncontaining oxygen to other arteries. The aorta can become \nnarrow (often because of a build -up of fatty acids on its walls) or \nit may beco me weakened because of a split (dissection) in the \ninternal wall. The aorta may also weaken because of an \n\u2018aneurysm\u2019 which means that the artery wall becomes thin and \nexpands.  A stent graft might be necessary to bypass the \nnarrowed or weakened part of the  artery.  \n \nEndovascular repair involves a surgeon passing a catheter (a \nflexible plastic tube) through small incisions in a distal artery, \nthrough the blood vessels to the site of the aneurysm. The \ncatheter delivers a stent graft (a fabric tube held in plac e by \nmetal wire stents) to the site of the aneurysm where it is put in \nposition in the affected segment of the aorta.

Swelling \nand inflammation develop in response to the infection. Inf ected \nbrain cells, white blood cells and organisms collect in an area of \nthe brain, a membrane forms and creates the abscess. While this \nimmune response can protect the brain from the infection, an \nabscess may put pressure on delicate brain tissue.  \nA cran iotomy is a surgical operation in which part of the skull is \nremoved in order to access the brain.  \nYou can claim if you are diagnosed with an intracerebral abscess \nwhich is treated by surgical drainage by craniotomy by a \nConsultant Neurosurgeon.

Or driving on past the petrol station when the fuel gauge is in the red.   \nWho does that deliberately? But if you can get a reward for taking a risk, it\u2019s different.  \nFor instance, if you leave it until the last minute to book a holiday, you risk missing out,  but on the upside you could get a bargain too.\n1Please seek professional advice if you are considering amending  your fund choices.\nWhen you invest your money, you hope for a reward, or profit, but youknow you take a risk.

If your \nretirement is 10 or more years away, you can afford to take a higher risk with your investments for a potentially bigger payback, as there will be time to recover any losses in investment markets. \nAs you get closer to retirement, however, it makes sense to invest in lower risk funds as  \nyou will have less time to recover any losses and you should be thinking about locking in \nyour savings at this stage. The Irish Life EMPOWER Personal Lifestyle Strategy (EMPOWER PLS), which is the default under option 1 \u2018Be My Guide\u2019, automatically moves your savings from high risk to low risk funds as you approach retirement.\nWHY TAKE A RISK?\nIf you do not have an enormous appetite for risk, you could leave your investment in the Cash Fund. While you\u2019d be taking virtually no investment risk, you\u2019d also get a very small or negative return. \nInvesting is for the long run. Not good if you want it to pay for a holiday in a few months. \nBut much better if you\u2019re saving for something that\u2019s years, or even decades, away - like \nretirement. That\u2019s because even if the value of your investments goes down, there\u2019s plenty \nof time for it to go back up again.\nHOW MUCH RISK?\nOne question this guide asks is: how much risk do you want to take? It comes down to a choice of: a lot, a bit or a little - that\u2019s high, medium or low risk. Your investments can mix all three levels of risk and this mix can change as time goes on. Depending on what investment option you take, these changes will be made automatically for you or you can make the changes yourself. \n2", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "8a47f931-a453-4435-8d7a-e35dac8b9b54": {"__data__": {"id_": "8a47f931-a453-4435-8d7a-e35dac8b9b54", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "5", "file_name": "investment-brochure.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "fc1efa76-a786-4ff9-b0ae-a1c1604539cb", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "5", "file_name": "investment-brochure.pdf"}, "hash": "9bdc7f43f3825ba1dc9b843ebbbb1e07c9cd9a221192df18c249d534d5b09b88"}}, "hash": "9bdc7f43f3825ba1dc9b843ebbbb1e07c9cd9a221192df18c249d534d5b09b88", "text": "3OPTION 1 - BE MY GUIDE\nThis is the default option.

By the time you are six years from retirement, 50% of your money will have been \nswitched into the EMPOWER Stability Fund, which mostly invests in bonds and cash but also has an allocation to multi-assets, equities and property. The remaining 50% of your money will continue to be invested in the EMPOWER Growth Fund at this stage. This aims to make your returns steadier, so they won\u2019t go up quite as much in good times, but won\u2019t drop so much in \nbad times either.ANNUITY MATCH TAX FREE CASH APPROVED RETIREMENT FUND MATCH\nWarning: The value of your investment may go down as well as up.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "efa200fc-8a5a-46a4-b95a-62801ce66506": {"__data__": {"id_": "efa200fc-8a5a-46a4-b95a-62801ce66506", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "7", "file_name": "investment-brochure.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "51c0a0be-6397-45f0-9d50-6f9e8f6e7757", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "7", "file_name": "investment-brochure.pdf"}, "hash": "097b0b371259ecedfebff2c5a9812a25ad10acc080c7c4ea794c0eec846534cb"}}, "hash": "097b0b371259ecedfebff2c5a9812a25ad10acc080c7c4ea794c0eec846534cb", "text": "5 6 YEARS TO GO TO RETIREMENT\nWhat Happens\nDepending on your personal circumstances, your retirement savings will be gradually switched into different investment funds to match how they can be used when you retire. \n\u2022 The first priority is to protect the tax free lump sum you can take at retirement and the maximum amount allowed for this will be gradually switched into the EMPOWER Cash Fund.  \n\u2022 Thereafter, if there is anything leftover, a target income of 25% of your salary, exclusive of the  State Pension, is aimed for by switching some of your retirement savings into the EMPOWER Pension for Life Fund.

That will have an impact on the types of assets your money is invested in. \nPros:  This approach aims to achieve higher returns for your savings than the market  \n average for similar investments. This is because managers have the freedom to  \n move your money to investments that are doing better than the market overall.\nCons:  There is a higher risk associated with active management as poor decisions by  \n the investment manager could result in a lower return for your savings than the  \n market average.

You won\u2019t have a salary, but you\u2019ll still need money to live on and to \nenjoy yourself. So it pays to save money now while you\u2019re earning. Saving for your future is sensible and worthwile. Your pension plan is key to achieving this.\nThe Irish Life and Canada Life Defined Contribution (DC) Plan was set up on 1 November 2011. It is registered with the Pensions Authority (registration number is PB 251543) and it \nhas been approved by the Revenue Commissioners (Revenue reference number is 353).  \nSO, WHAT IS A DEFINED CONTRIBUTION (DC) PLAN?\nA DC pension plan means that the amount you regularly save into your pension fund is defined, e.g. 10% of your salary goes into your pension fund.\nWith this type of plan, the benefit you receive when you retire is based on the pension fund \nthat you have saved up during your working years. \nThe Irish Life and Canada Life DC Plan is a company pension plan. All Irish Life and Canada \nLife companies participating in the plan will, as your employer, help you by contributing into your pension plan too. Details of participating group companies and contact details are set out in the back of this booklet.\nIn this guide, we will explain how  \nyour EMPOWER plan works:\n1SECTION\nIT\u2019S TIME TO SAVE FOR  \nYOUR FUTURE\nWHAT MAKES \nUP YOUR \nRETIREMENT \nSAVINGS?WHAT YOU \nGET WHEN \nYOU RETIREHOW THIS IS \nINVESTED", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "5294be8a-d95e-4c6a-bc93-4868278be3db": {"__data__": {"id_": "5294be8a-d95e-4c6a-bc93-4868278be3db", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "3", "file_name": "member-booklet.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "8f2d3827-59a8-4e0d-b408-eaa0438af032", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "3", "file_name": "member-booklet.pdf"}, "hash": "ae3c186a68bc70fc17d3a0ccfbcf1a67fa351186d50bee9fb2be7e461b237843"}}, "hash": "ae3c186a68bc70fc17d3a0ccfbcf1a67fa351186d50bee9fb2be7e461b237843", "text": "3\nYour fund value at retirement will depend on:\n2SECTION\nWHAT MAKES UP YOUR \nRETIREMENT SAVINGS?                                                                            \nREGULAR CONTRIBUTIONS\nAs part of a DC company pension plan, your regular contributions are made up of : VALUE AT \nRETIREMENTREGULAR CONTRIBUTIONS\nINVESTMENT RETURNADDITIONAL VOLUNTARY CONTRIBUTIONS\u20ac \u20ac\n\u20ac\u20ac \u20ac\n\u20ac \u20ac\n2. \nYour employer contributions  \n(your employer makes a  \ncontribution on your behalf)1.\nYour contributions", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "84ce8308-e586-417d-9be1-f0900dce746c": {"__data__": {"id_": "84ce8308-e586-417d-9be1-f0900dce746c", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "4", "file_name": "member-booklet.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "9a1c303e-eee0-499e-b8ae-c9f7c4b08764", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "4", "file_name": "member-booklet.pdf"}, "hash": "65206f01ae9a0f88d19a9a1d8e9dd1b8079f27fa1178fd2f6967a269f2f6def9"}}, "hash": "65206f01ae9a0f88d19a9a1d8e9dd1b8079f27fa1178fd2f6967a269f2f6def9", "text": "4\nEMPLOYEE AND EMPLOYER CONTRIBUTION RATE\nFor exact rates applicable to your pension plan please check the Employee Pensions  \nPage on the intranet.

Just remember that your company does not match your AVC contributions. \nThe below table displays the percentage of your income that you will receive tax relief for \nwhen contributing to a pension plan.

There is no maximum payment that can be made, but you may only \nclaim tax relief within Revenue limits.

Deferred pension - You can leave the value of your pension fund in your pension plan until you retire and then use it to get a retirement benefit.\n2. You may be able to transfer the value of your retirement savings to a new employer\u2019s pension plan (if your new employer\u2019s plan allows).\n3. If you do not join another company pension plan and you decide to set up a Personal Retirement Savings Account (PRSA) you can, in certain circumstances, transfer the value of your retirement savings into it. \n4. You can take the value of your retirement savings from your current employer\u2019s plan when you leave and invest in what is known as a Buy-Out-Bond or a Personal Retirement Bond (PRB). This is an individual lump-sum investment. \n5. You can normally opt to take your benefits from the Pension Plan at any time after age 50, once you have left service.\nShould you leave your current employer within two years of joining the pension plan, you may be required to take a refund of the value of your own contributions less tax.
